	"Canterbury Tales: \n\t General Prologue": "When that April with his showers sweet\nThe drought of March has pierced root deep, And bathed each vein with liquor of such power That engendered from it is the flower,\nWhen Zephyrus too with his gentle strife,\nTo every field and wood, has brought new life In tender shoots, and the youthful sun\nHalf his course through the Ram has run, And little birds are making melody,\nWho all the night with open eye do sleep – Nature their hearts in every way so pricks – Then people long to go on pilgrimage,\nAnd palmers who seek out foreign strands, To far-off shrines, renowned in sundry lands; And specially, from every shire’s end\nOf England, down to Canterbury they wend, The holy blissful martyr there to seek,\nWho had aided them when they were sick.\nIt befell that in that season on a day, In Southwark at The Tabard as I lay, Ready to set out on my pilgrimage\nTo Canterbury with pious courage, There came at night to that hostelry Quite nine and twenty in a company Of sundry folk who had chanced to fall Into a fellowship, and pilgrims all,\nThat towards Canterbury meant to ride.\nThe chambers and the stables were full wide, And we housed at our ease, and of the best; And shortly, when the sun had gone to rest, I had such speech with each and everyone,That of their fellowship I soon made one, Agreeing I would make an early rise,\nTo take our way there, as I now advise.\nNonetheless while I have time and space, Before a step more of my tale I pace,\nIt seems to me in full accord with reason, To tell you everything of their condition, Of each of them, as they appeared to me, And who they were, and of what degree, And what apparel they were travelling in; And with a knight then I will first begin.\nThere was a KNIGHT and he a worthy man, That from the day on which he first began,\nTo ride abroad, had followed chivalry,\nTruth, honour, courtesy and charity.\nHe had fought nobly in his lord’s war,\nAnd ridden to the fray, and no man more, As much in Christendom as heathen place, And ever honoured for his worth and grace. When we took Alexandria was there;\nOften at table held the place of honour, Above all other nations too in Prussia; Campaigned in Lithuania and Russia,\nNo Christian man of his rank more often. At the siege of Algeciras had he been,\nIn Granada, and on Moroccan shore;\nHe was at Ayash and Antalya\nWhen taken, and many times had been\nIn action on the Mediterranean Sea.\nOf mortal battles he had seen fifteen,\nAnd fought for the faith at Tramissene Thrice in the lists and always slain his foe. This same worthy knight had been also With the Emir of Balat once, at work\nWith him against some other heathen Turk; Won him a reputation highly prized,\nAnd though he was valiant, he was wise,And in his manner modest as a maid.\nAnd never a discourtesy he said\nIn all his life to those who met his sight; He was a very perfect gentle knight.\nBut to tell of his equipment, his array,\nHis horses fine, he wore no colours gay Sported a tunic, padded fustian\nOn which his coat of mail left many a stain; For he was scarcely back from his voyage, And going now to make his pilgrimage.\nWith him there was his son, a young SQUIRE, Lover and lively bachelor entire\nWith locks as crisp as from a curling-press;\nOf twenty years of age he was, I guess.\nOf his stature, he was of middle height, Wonderfully agile, powerful in a fight. And had served a while in the cavalry, In Flanders, in Artois and Picardy,\nAnd done so well, and in so short a space, He hoped for favour from his lady’s grace. Like to a meadow he was embroidered, One full of fresh flowers white and red. Singing he was, or playing flute all day;\nHe was as fresh as is the month of May.\nShort was his gown, with sleeves both long and wide; He knew how to sit a horse, and could ride.\nHe could make songs, and compose aright,\nJoust and dance, and draw things well and write.\nHe loved so hotly night through without fail\nHe slept no more than does the nightingale. Courteous he was, humble, attentive, able,\nAnd carved for his father at the table.\nA YEOMAN had he (servants did forgo Other than this, and chose to travel so),\nOne who was clad in coat and hood of green. A sheaf of peacock arrows, bright and keen Sheathed in his belt he bore right properly –Well could he dress his gear, yeomanly;\nHis arrows never drooped with feathers low – And in his hand he bore a mighty bow. Cropped hair he had, and a nut-brown visage; Of woodcraft he well knew all the usage.\nOn his arm an archer’s brace he wore,\nAnd by his side a buckler and a sword,\nAnd at the other side a jaunty dagger Ornamented, and sharp as any spear;\nOn his breast St Christopher did gleam.\nHe bore a horn, the baldric was of green.\nHe truly was a forester, I guess.\nThere was also a nun, a PRIORESS,\nHer smile itself ingenuous and coy.\nHer greatest oath was only ‘by Saint Loy’, And she was called Madame Eglentine.\nFull well she sung the service, divine, Intoning through her nose, all seemly,\nAnd fair French she spoke, all elegantly, After the school of Stratford-atte-Bowe;\nFor French of Paris was not hers to know. At meals she had been taught well withal; And from her lips she let no morsel fall,\nNor dipped her fingers in the sauce too deep; Well could she take a morsel and then keep The slightest drop from falling on her breast; Courtesy it was that pleased her best.\nHer upper lip she would wipe so clean\nThat in her cup no trace of grease was seen When she had drunk her draught; and to eat, In a most seemly manner took her meat. And certainly she had a cheerful manner, Pleasant and amiable in her behaviour,\nTook pains to imitate the ways of court, Display a stately bearing as she ought,\nAnd be considered worthy of reverence.\nAs for consideration of her conscience,She was so charitable, tender, anxious,\nShe would weep if she but saw a mouse\nCaught in a trap, if it were dead or bled.\nOf slender hounds she had, that she fed\nWith roasted flesh, or milk, and fine white bread; But wept sorely when one of them was dead\nOr if men struck it with a stick too hard, And all was sentiment and tender heart. Her wimple was pleated in a seemly way, Her nose was elegant, her eyes blue-grey; Her lips quite fine, and also soft and red, But certainly she had a fair forehead,\nIt was almost a span broad, I deem,\nFor she was not small of build, I mean.\nHer cloak was very elegant, I saw;\nFine coral round her arm she wore\nA rosary, the larger beads were green,\nAnd from it hung a brooch of golden sheen, On which there first was writ a crowned A, And after: ‘Amor vincit omnia’.\nAnother NUN she had with her, and she Was her chaplain, and with them priests three. A MONK there was, of the highest degree, Who loved to hunt, agent of a monastery,\nA manly man, for an Abbot’s role quite able. Full many a fine horse had he in his stable, His bridle, when he rode, men might hear Jingling in a whistling wind as clear,\nAnd quite as loud as does the chapel bell. Now as this lord was prior of his cell,\nThe rule of Saint Benedict and Saint Mawr,\nAs old and somewhat strict he would ignore, This same monk scorned the old world’s pace, And spurred after the new world, apace.\nHe gave not for that text a plucked hen\nThat says that hunters are not holy men,\nAnd that a monk when he grows heedlessIs like a fish that’s all waterless –\nThat is to say a monk out of his cloister –\nBut he held that text not worth an oyster.\nAnd I agreed his views were scarcely bad:\nWhat! Should he study, drive himself quite mad, In his cloister over a book must pore,\nOr labour with his hands, and toil the more\nAs Augustine bids? How would the world run? Let Augustine keep his labour for his own!\nTherefore he was a hunting man outright. Greyhounds he had, as swift as birds in flight; Tracking with dogs and hunting the hare\nWas all his pleasure, no cost did he spare.\nI saw his sleeves were trimmed at the wrist With grey fur, and of the country’s finest; And to fasten his hood beneath his chin, He had a wrought-gold elaborate pin;\nA love-knot in the larger end there was.\nHis head was bald, and shone like any glass, And his face, as if he had been anointed; He was a lord full fat, and well appointed. His bulging eyeballs, rolling in his head, Glowing like a cauldron-fire well-fed; Supple his boots, his horse in perfect state. Now certainly he was a fair prelate;\nHe was not pale like some tormented ghost. A fat swan he loved best of any roast;\nHis palfrey was as brown as is a berry.\nA FRIAR there was, a wanton one and merry, A Limiter, a very jovial man.\nIn all the friars’ four orders none that can\nLead a discussion in fairer language.\nAnd he had arranged many a marriage Of young women, granting each a dower. He was a noble pillar of his Order. Well-beloved and intimate was he\nWith Franklins within his boundary,And also worthy women of the town;\nHad power to confess coat and gown –\nAs he said himself – more than a curate, Having licence from his bishop to do it. Full sweetly he would hear confessions, And very pleasant were his absolutions.\nHe was an easy man at granting penance From which he made more than a pittance. When to a poor Order alms are given\nIt is a token that a man’s well-shriven;\nSince he dared claim that from the intent,\nOf giving, then the man was penitent.\nFor many a man is so hard of heart\nHe cannot weep, though he feels the smart. Therefore instead of weeping and prayer, Better to give the poor friars silverware.\nHis sleeve’s end was stuffed with pocket-knives And gilded pins, to give to pretty wives.\nHe could hold a note for sure; could sing\nAnd play quite sweetly on the tuneful string. Such competitions he won easily.\nHis neck was white as the fleur-de-lis;\nAnd he was as strong as any champion.\nHe knew the taverns well in every town,\nAnd all the barmaids and innkeepers,\nRather than the lepers and the beggars\nSince such a worthy man as he\nIt suited not his calling or degree,\nWith such lepers to maintain acquaintance.\nIt is not seemly – helps no man advance –\nTo have dealings with such poor people,\nOnly with the rich, sellers of victuals.\nAn everywhere a profit might arise,\nHe wore a courteous and humble guise;\nThere was no man half so virtuous.\nHe was the finest beggar of his house\n– and paid a fixed fee for the right;None of his brethren poached in his sight. For though a widow lacked a shoe\nSo pleasant was his ‘In principio’,\nHe yet would gain a farthing as he went. His income was far greater than his rent, And he romped around, like any whelp. In settling disputes he could help,\nNot like a friar from a cloister,\nWith threadbare cloak, like needy scholar, But he was like a doctor or a pope;\nOf double worsted was his demi-cloak,\nA bell shaped from the mould, its fashion. He lisped a little out of affectation,\nTo sound his English sweet upon the tongue; And in his harping, whenever he had sung, His eyes would twinkle in his head aright\nAs do the stars on high in frosty night. Hubert his name, this worthy Limiter.\nA MERCHANT was there, with a forked beard, Dressed in motley, high on horse he sat.\nUpon his head a Flemish beaver hat,\nBuckled his boots were, fair and neatly.\nHe made his comments solemnly, fully, Boasting of profits ever increasing,\nWishing sea-trade secure, more than anything, Twixt Middleburgh and the River Orwell.\nHe could exchange monies, buy and sell. This worthy man made such use of his wits; No one knew he was beset by debts,\nSo stately his manner of behaving,\nIn his bargaining, and money-lending.\nTruly a worthy man then, all in all,\nBut truth to tell, I know not what he’s called.\nA CLERK there was of Oxford town also, Who had set himself to logic long ago. Thinner was his horse than many a rake, And he was none too fat, I’ll undertake,But gazed quite hollowly, and soberly.\nHis jacket threadbare, where the eye could see; For he had not yet found a benefice,\nFar too unworldly ever to seek office.\nHe would rather have at his bed-head\nTwenty books, clad in black or red,\nOf Aristotle and his philosophy,\nThan rich robes, fiddle, and sweet psaltery. But though he was a true philosopher\nNo stone for making gold lay in his coffer! But every single penny his friends lent,\nOn books and on learning it was spent,\nAnd for the souls he offered up a prayer,\nOf those who funded him to be a scholar.\nOf study he took most care, and most heed. He spoke not one word more than he need, And that was formal, said with reverence, Short, and quick, and in a noble sentence. Agreeing with moral virtue all his speech,\nAnd gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.\nA SERGEANT AT LAW, wise and cautious, Often consulted at St Paul’s porch and such, Was also there, rich in excellence.\nDiscreet he was, a man for reverence –\nOr so he seemed, his words being so wise. He had often been a Justice at assize,\nBy letters patent and by full commission. By his science and his high renown\nOf fees and robes he garnered many a one. So great a buyer of land was never known; All was his in fee-simple, in effect.\nHis purchases were not the least suspect. More business than he had, no man has, And yet he seemed busier than he was.\nHe had correctly cases, judgements, all From King William’s time in men’s recall. Moreover he could draw up anything,That no man might find fault with its drafting; And every statute he could cite by rote,\nHe rode along in a simple striped coat,\nTied with a silken belt, its clasps of metal;\nOf his array I will no further tell.\nA FRANKLIN was in his company;\nWhite was his beard as is the daisy.\nOf his complexion he was sanguine;\nHe loved a sop in wine each morning.\nTo live in delight was ever his wont,\nFor he was Epicurus’ very son,\nWho held the view that perfect delight\nWas the true felicity outright.\nA hospitable householder was he\nSaint Julian he was to his county.\nHis bread and ale always second to none;\nAnd no better wine than his was known.\nHis house was never short of fish and flesh, Of pastry dishes, and all so plenteous\nIt snowed in his house with meat and drink, And all the dainties of which men might think. In accordance with the seasons of the year,\nSo he changed his dinner and his supper.\nFull many a fat partridge had he in coop,\nAnd many a bream and pike in the pool.\nWoe to his cook unless his sauces were Pungent and tasty, and every dish prepared! His table fixed in his hall stood always\nReady set with covers, every day.\nAt court-sessions he was lord and sire;\nAnd oftentimes was Member for the Shire.\nA two-edged dagger and a purse of silk\nHung at his girdle, white as morning milk.\nA Sheriff had he been, and a lawyer;\nNowhere lived so worthy a landowner.\nA HABERDASHER, CARPENTER, a WEAVER A DYER too, and TAPESTRY-MAKER,Were there all clothed in the livery\nOf their imposing guild fraternity.\nFull fresh and new their costume was; Their knives were mounted not with brass But all with silver, wrought clean and well, Their girdles and their pouches as befell. Each of them seemed a splendid burgess Fit to grace a guildhall on a dais.\nEach owning as much wisdom as man can,\nWas suitable to be an alderman,\nFor they had property enough and rent,\nAnd wives too who would give their assent. They would be blamed for sure were it not done; It is a fine thing to be called ‘Madame’,\nAnd go to vigil before the celebration, With mantle royally carried, on occasion.\nA COOK they had with them I own\nTo boil the chickens with the marrow-bones, And pungent flavouring, spices without fail. Well could he distinguish London ale;\nHe could roast and seethe and boil and fry, Make thick soup and bake a tasty pie.\nBut a mortal pity, it seemed to me,\nThat on his shin an ulcerous sore had he. Yet a fricassee, he made it with the best.\nA SHIPMAN was there, from out the west; A Dartmouth man for all I understood.\nHe rode a hired hack, as best he could,\nIn a woollen gown that reached his knee,\nA dagger hanging on a cord had he,\nAbout his neck, under his arm, and down.\nThe summer heat had tanned his visage brown. And certainly he was a splendid fellow;\nFull many a draught of wine he made flow From Bordeaux, the merchant fast asleep,\nThe nicer rules of conscience did not keep:\nIf he fought, and gained the upper hand,He sent men home by water to every land. As for his skill in calculating tides,\nCurrents, and every other risk besides, Harbours and moons, on every voyage, There was none such from Hull to Carthage. Hardy he was, wise in his undertakings,\nIn many a tempest had his beard been shaken. He knew all the havens that there were\nFrom Gotland’s Isle to Cape Finisterre,\nAnd every creek in Brittany and Spain;\nThe barque he owned was called the Magdalene. With us there was a DOCTOR OF PHYSIC.\nIn all this world none ever saw his like On points of physic and of surgery,\nFor he was grounded in astronomy.\nHe knew the best hours for the sick,\nBy the power of his natural magic.\nAnd could select the right ascendant\nFor making talismans for his patient.\nHe knew the cause of every malady, Whether of hot or cold, or moist and dry, And where engendered, of what humour; He was a truly perfect practitioner.\nThe cause known, and of the ill its root,\nHe gave the sick man remedy to suit.\nTo send him medicines, his apothecaries\nAnd potions too, they were ever ready,\nFor each enhanced the other’s profiting – There needed no new friendship there to win. He was well-versed in Aesculapius,\nAnd Dioscorides and likewise Rufus, Old Hippocrates, Hali and Galen, Serapion, Rhazes and Avicen,\nAverroes, Damascenus, Constantinus, Bernard, and Gaddesden, and Gilbertus. In his diet quite moderate was he,\nFor it avoided superfluity,But nourishing it was, digestible.\nHe made little study of the Bible.\nIn red and blue, and colours of that ilk, Lined with taffeta, was clad, and silk. And yet he was most careful of expense; He kept the money won from pestilence. For gold in physic is a cordial;\nTherefore he loved gold above all.\nA good WIFE was there from next to BATH, But pity was that she was somewhat deaf.\nIn cloth-making she was excellent,\nSurpassing those of Ypres and of Ghent.\nIn all the parish there was no wife, so\nBefore her to the Offertory might go –\nAnd if they did, indeed, so angry she\nThat she was quite put out of charity.\nHer kerchiefs were finely wove I found;\nI dare to swear those weighed a good ten pounds, That on a Sunday she wore on her head.\nHere hose were of a fine scarlet red,\nAnd tightly tied: her shoes full soft and new. Bold was her face, and fair and red of hue. Had been a worthy woman all her life; Husbands at the church-door she had five, Besides other company in her youth –\nNo need to speak of that just now, in truth. And thrice had she been to Jerusalem;\nShe had crossed many a foreign stream.\nAt Boulogne she had been, and Rome,\nSt James of Compostella, and Cologne,\nAnd she knew much of wandering by the way, Gap toothed was she, truthfully to say.\nAt ease upon a saddle-horse she sat,\nWell wimpled, and on her head a hat\nAs wide as a small buckler or large shield,\nHer large hips an over-skirt concealed,\nAnd on her feet a pair of sharp spurs sat.In fellowship she loved to laugh and chat; And remedies for love she had, by chance, For in that art she knew the oldest dance.\nA holy man there was of good renown, Who was a poor PARSON to a town,\nBut rich he was in holy thought and works. He also was a learned man, a clerk,\nThat Christ’s gospel earnestly would preach; His parishioners devoutly he would teach. Benign he was and wondrous diligent,\nAnd in adversity extremely patient,\nAnd proven to be such as many times.\nHe was loth to curse men over tithes,\nBut preferred to give, without a doubt,\nTo the poor parishioners round about, From his own goods and the offerings,\nHe found sufficiency in little things.\nWide was his parish, and houses far asunder, But he neglected naught, in rain or thunder, In sickness or affliction went to all\nThe farthest in his parish, great or small,\nUpon his feet, and in his hand a stave.\nThis fine example to his flock he gave,\nThat first he wrought, and afterward he taught. Out of the gospel he those words had caught; And this maxim he would add thereto,\nThat if gold rust, what should iron do?\nFor if the priest be foul in whom we trust,\nNo wonder if the layman turn to rust!\nAnd shame it is, and let priests note, to see\nThe shepherd doused in shit, the sheep still clean. The true example the priest ought to give\nIs by his cleanness how the sheep should live.\nHe did not set his benefice to hire\nAnd leave his sheep encumbered in the mire, Running off to London to Saint Paul’s,\nTo work a wealthy chantry for dead souls,Or in guild brotherhood remain enrolled\nBut dwelt at home and cared well for his fold, So that no wolf should make his task miscarry. He was a shepherd not a mercenary.\nAnd though he was holy and virtuous,\nHe did not scorn the sinful, nor because\nOf it in speech was proud or over-fine,\nBut in his teaching was discreet, benign;\nTo draw folk towards heaven by gentleness, By good example – such was his business.\nBut if anyone proved obstinate,\nWhoever he was, of high or low estate,\nHe would rebuke him sharply, him to punish. A better priest I think there nowhere none is. He never looked for pomp or reverence,\nNor showed a too fastidious conscience,\nBut Christ’s lore, and his Apostles’ twelve,\nHe taught, but first he followed it himself.\nWith him there was a PLOUGHMAN, was his brother, Many a load of dung, one time or other,\nHe had carted, a good true worker he,\nLiving in peace and perfect charity.\nGod loved he best with all his whole heart At all times, whether with delight or smart, Then his neighbour loved he as himself.\nHe would thresh the corn, and dig and delve, For Christ’s sake, grant the poor their hour, Without reward, if it lay in his power.\nHis tithes he paid in full, fair and well, Both of his labour and his capital.\nIn a loose tunic he rode on a mare.\nThere was a REEVE also and a MILLER,\nA SUMMONER and a PARDONER as well, A college MANCIPLE, and then myself.\nThe MILLER was a strong man I own;\nA stout fellow, big in brawn and bone.\nIt served him well, for, everywhere, the man,At wrestling, always looked to win the ram. Broad, thick-set, short in the upper arm, Off its hinges, he lifted any door,\nOr ran at it and broke it with his head.\nHis beard, as any sow or fox, was red, And broad as well, as if it were a spade. On the tip of his nose he displayed\nA wart, and on it stood a tuft of hair, Red as the bristles in a sow’s ear.\nHis nostrils were as black as they were wide; A sword and buckler he wore at his side. His mouth as great was as a great furnace. He was a loudmouth and to his disgrace Told stories most of sin and harlotry.\nHe stole corn, and made one toll pay three; Yet had the golden thumb, a mystery!\nA white coat and a blue hood wore he;\nThe bagpipes he could blow well and sound, And that was how he piped us out of town.\nThe MANCIPLE was of the Inner Temple, All purchasers might follow his example\nOf wisdom in the buying of victuals;\nFor whether he paid cash or owed it all\nHe was so careful always in his purchase, That he was all prepared and acted first. Now is it not a wonder of God’s grace That a man so illiterate can outpace\nThe wisdom of a host of learned men?\nOf masters he had more than thrice ten, Expert in the law and meritorious,\nOf whom there were a dozen in that house Worthy to be stewards of rent and land For any lord who lives in England,\nAnd show him the income to be had Debt-free, from his estates, less he were mad, Or be as frugal as he should desire;\nAnd they were able to assist a shireIn any case that chanced to arise – And yet this Manciple outdid the wise.\nThe REEVE was a slender, choleric man. His beard was shaved as close as any can; His hair by his ears was fully shorn;\nThe top was cropped like a priest before. His legs were long, and very lean,\nLike sticks they were – no calves to be seen. He kept a tidy granary and bin;\nNo auditor could get the best of him.\nWell could he judge from drought or rain The yield of his seed and of his grain.\nHis lord’s sheep, beef-cattle, and his dairy, His swine, his horses, stock and poultry, Was wholly in this Reeve’s governance And he made reckoning by covenant, Since his lord had only twenty years;\nNo man could find him ever in arrears.\nNo bailiff, cowherd, servant of any kind\nBut their deceits and tricks were in his mind; They feared him like the plague, is my belief. He had a pleasant dwelling on a heath,\nWith green trees shadowed was the sward. He could purchase better than his lord;\nHe had riches of his own privately.\nHe could please his lord subtly,\nGiving and lending of his own goods,\nAnd earn his thank you and a coat and hood. In youth he had a good and learned master; He was a fine craftsman, a carpenter.\nThis Reeve sat on a farm-horse that was\nAll dappled grey and bore the name of Scot. A long bluish top-coat he displayed,\nAnd by his side he bore a rusty blade.\nOf Norfolk was this Reeve of whom I tell, Near a town that men call Bawdeswell.\nHis gown was tucked up like a friar’s about,And he always rode the hindmost on the route. A SUMMONER was with us in that place,\nWho had a fiery-red cherubim’s face, Carbuncled so, and his eyes were narrow.\nHe was hot and lecherous as a sparrow,\nWith scabby black brows and scrubby beard; Of his visage children were a-feared.\nNo quicksilver, lead salve, or brimstone, Borax, ceruse, or oil of tartar known,\nNo ointment that would cleanse and bite, Could cure him of his pimples white,\nOr of the lumps rising from his cheeks.\nWell loved he garlic, onions, and leeks,\nAnd to drink strong wine, as red as blood; Making him speak, and cry, as madman would. And when he had drunk, and the wine was in, Then he would speak no word but Latin.\nA few tags he had, some two or three,\nThat he had learned out of some decree –\nNo wonder, since he heard them every day. And you well know moreover how a jay\nCan say ‘Walter’ better than the Pope –\nBut try any other matter’s scope,\nThen had he spent all his philosophy;\nAy ‘Questio quid iuris’ was his plea.\nHe was a noble rogue and a kind;\nA better fellow no man could find.\nHe would allow, for a quart of wine,\nA good friend to keep a concubine\nA twelvemonth and excuse him fully;\nAnd he could pluck a fool privately.\nAnd if he made a good friend anywhere,\nHe would teach him not to have a care\nIn such a case of the Archdeacon’s curse, Unless a man’s soul lay in his purse,\nFor in his purse he should punished be.\n‘The purse is the Archdeacon’s hell,’ said he.But well I know he lied in what he said; For his curse each guilty man should dread, Since absolution saves, but slays that writ, And so ware of that word Significavit.\nHe had in his power as he pleased\nAll the young folk of the diocese,\nKnew their secrets, they by him were led. A garland had he set upon his head,\nBig as an inn-sign’s holly on a stake;\nA buckler he had made him of a cake.\nWith him there rode a noble PARDONER Of Charing Cross, his friend and his peer, Returned directly from the Court of Rome. He sang out loud: ‘Come hither, love, to me!’ The Summoner sang a powerful bass around; Never a trumpet of half so great a sound.\nThe Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax, But smooth it hung like a hank of flax. In clusters hung the locks he possessed, With which his shoulders he overspread; But thin they fell, in strands, one by one. But hood, to adorn them, he wore none, For it was trussed up in his wallet –\nHe thought he rode fashionably set; Dishevelled, save his cap, he rode all bare. Such bulging eyeballs had he as a hare.\nA pilgrim badge had he sewn on his cap;\nHis wallet lay before him in his lap,\nBrimful of pardons, come from Rome hotfoot. A voice he had as small as has a goat;\nNo beard had he, nor ever looked to have;\nAs smooth it were as it were lately shaved –\nI judge he was a gelding or a mare.\nBut of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware, Never was such another Pardoner.\nAnd in his bag a pillow-case was there,\nWhich he claimed was Our Lady’s veil;He said he had a fragment of the sail\nThat Saint Peter used, when he skimmed Upon the sea till Jesus summoned him.\nHe had a cross of brass set with stones, And in a glass, he had pigs’ bones.\nAnd with these relics, when he had to hand Some poor parson living on the land,\nIn one day he gathered in more money Than the parson in a month of Sundays. And thus with feigned flattery, his japes Made people and the parson his apes.\nBut to tell true from first to last,\nHe was in church a noble ecclesiast.\nHe read a lesson well or a story,\nBut best of all he sang an Offertory.\nFor well he knew, when that song was sung, He must preach and well tune his tongue To win silver, as he well knew how; Therefore he sang more sweetly and loud.\nNow I have told you in a brief clause, The array, condition, number and the cause Whereby assembled was this company,\nIn Southwark at that noble hostelry\nCalled The Tabard, fast by The Bell.\nBut now the time has come for me to tell How we behaved on that same night,\nAt that hostelry where we did alight;\nAnd after will I tell, at every stage,\nAll the remainder of our pilgrimage.\nBut first I pray you of your courtesy,\nNot to consider me unmannerly\nIf I speak plainly in this matter,\nIn telling you their words hereafter, Though I speak their words literally;\nFor this you know as well as me,\nWhoso tells the tale of another man\nMust repeat as closely as he canEvery word, if it be in his power,\nHowever coarse or broad his dower\nOf words, or else his tale will be untrue,\nOr feign things, inventing words anew.\nHe may spare none, though it were his brother, Must say the one word if he says the other. Christ himself spoke plain in Holy Writ,\nAnd you well know no coarseness is in it.\nAs Plato says, to any who can read,\nThe words must be cousin to the deed.\nAlso I beg you, if you will, forgive me\nIf I have not placed folk in due degree\nHere in this tale, as they indeed should stand;\nI lack the wit, you may well understand.\nOur HOST made great cheer for everyone, And down to supper set us all anon.\nHe served us with victuals of the best:\nStrong was the wine, we drank with zest.\nA handsome man our Host was withal,\nAnd fit to be a marshal in a hall.\nA large man he was with striking eyes;\nNo fairer burgess was there in Cheapside. Bold in his speech, and wise, and well taught, And of honest manhood he lacked naught. Add that he was a truly merry man;\nAnd after supper jokingly began\nTo speak of entertainment and other things, After we had paid our reckonings,\nSaying to us: ‘Now lordings, truly\nTo me you are right welcome, heartily!\nFor by my troth and telling you no lie,\nI have not seen this year such folk go by\nAs gathered together in this tavern now.\nAnd I would entertain, if I knew how,\nYet there is an entertainment, in my thoughts, To amuse you and it will cost you naught.\nYou go to Canterbury – God you speed!May the blissful martyr bless you indeed! – And well I know, as you go on your way You intend to chatter and make hay.\nFor truly, comfort and delight is none\nIn riding on the way dumb as a stone.\nAnd therefore I offer you some sport,\nAs I first said, to give you some comfort. And if you agree as one and consent\nEach of you to accept my judgement,\nAnd to work it as I to you will say, Tomorrow when you ride on your way, Now, by my father’s soul, he being dead,\nIf you lack merriment, be it on my head! Hold up your hands, without longer speech.’\nOur decision was not long to seek:\nWe thought it not worth serious debating, And gave him leave, without deliberating,\nAnd bade him give his orders as he wished, ‘Lordings,’ quoth he, ‘now listen to the rest – But hear me out, I pray, without disdain – Here is the point, to tell you short and plain: That each of you, to speed you on your way, On the journey there, shall tell two tales,\nTill Canterbury, I mean it so,\nAnd on the homeward way another two,\nOf adventures that did once befall.\nAnd which of you that bears them best of all – That is to say, who tells in this case\nTales the most serious that most solace –\nShall have a supper and we pay the cost,\nHere in this place, sitting by this post,\nWhen that we come again from Canterbury. And to make you all the more merry,\nI will myself gladly with you ride,\nAll at my own cost, and be your guide.\nAnd whoever my judgement does gainsay Shall pay all that we spend by the way.And if you will agree it shall be so, Tell me now, without more ado,\nAnd I will get me ready for the dawn.’\nThe thing was agreed, and our oath sworn With right good heart, and we begged also That he accordingly would do so,\nAnd that he act then as our governor,\nAnd of our tales be judge and recorder, And fix the supper at a certain price, And we would be ruled by his device, In high and low, and thus by one assent We all agreed to his true judgement. And the wine was brought, thereupon We drank, and to rest went everyone, Without our any longer tarrying.\nNext morning, when the day began to spring, Up rose our Host and roused us like the cock, And gathered us together in a flock;\nAnd forth we rode, at barely walking-pace\nTo Saint Thomas, and his watering place. And there our Host held the reins still, And said: ‘Lordings, hearken if you will! You know what you agreed, as I record. If even-song and morning-song accord, Let us see who shall tell the first tale.\nAs ever I hope to drink wine and ale,\nWhoever is a rebel to my judgement\nShall pay for all that on the way is spent.\nNow draw a straw before our journeying;\nAnd he that has the shortest shall begin.\n‘Sir Knight,’ quoth he, ‘my master and my lord, Now make the draw for that is our accord. Come near,’ quoth he, ‘my lady Prioress,\nAnd you, Sir Cleric, hide your bashfulness, No pondering now – a hand from everyone!’\nAt once by each the draw was begun; And to tell you how it was, as I relate,Whether by happenstance or chance or fate, The truth is this: the lot fell to the Knight, Which filled us all with joy and delight.\nAnd tell his tale he must, in due season, According to our pact and our decision,\nAs you have heard – what needs more ado? And when this good man saw that it was so, As he was wise and given to obedience\nAnd keeping promises with free assent,\nHe said: ‘Since I shall begin the game,\nWhy, welcome is the outcome, in God’s name! Now let us ride, and hark at what I say.’\nAnd with that word we rode forth on our way, And he began, all merry and full of cheer\nHis tale anon, and spoke as you may hear.",
	"Canterbury Tales: \n\t Nun's Priest's Prologue": "Ho!’ quoth the Knight, ‘good sire, no more of this! What you said is right enough, true it is\nAnd more, since a little grief and sadness\nIs due most folk, that’s right enough I guess.\nAs for myself, it’s great distress to me When men have been in great wealth and ease,\nTo hear then of their sudden fall, alas! And the contrary is joy and great solace, When a man that has been of poor estate, Climbs up above and proves so fortunate That he abides there in prosperity.\nSuch a thing is cheerful, it seems to me, And of such things it is good news to tell.’\n‘Yea,’ quoth our Host, ‘by Saint Paul’s bell, You speak the truth! This Monk, he cries aloud Of how Dame Fortune covered with a cloud\nI know not what, and speaks of tragedy –\nAs you have heard; yet, faith, no remedy\nIs it to bewail these things or complain\nWhen they are done, and also it brings pain, As you have said, to hear of heaviness.\nSir Monk, no more of it, may God you bless! You tale annoys all this good company.\nThat sort of talk is scarcely worth a flea, There’s no amusement in it, and no game. Wherefore, Sir Monk, Sir Piers by your name, I pray you heartily, tell of something else;Were it not for the clinking of the bells,\nThat from your bridle hang on every side,\nBy Heaven’s King, that for us all died,\nI should ere this have tumbled down in sleep, Though the slough below were ever so deep. Then would your tale have been told in vain! For certainly, as the clerks make plain, Whenever a man lacks an audience,\nNo use his uttering a single sentence.\nAnd well I know, the capacity is in me,\nAs to whether anything well told shall be.\nSire, say something of hunting, I you pray.’ ‘Nay,’ quoth the Monk, ‘I have no wish to play. Now, let another speak, my tale is told.’\nThen spoke our Host with rude speech and bold, And said unto the Nun’s Priest anon:\n‘Come near, good priest; come hither, now Sir John! Tell us such things as make the heart glad.\nBe blithe now, though you ride upon a nag! What though your horse be miserable and lean? If he will serve, why should you care a bean! See that your heart is ever merry, though.’\n‘Yea, sire,’ quoth he,’ yea, Host, and I will so, Not to be merry now would bring me blame.’ And right anon now he took up the game. And thus he spoke unto us everyone,\nThis sweet Priest, this goodly man, Sir John.",
	"Canterbury Tales: \n\t Merchant's Tale": "Once there was, dwelling in Lombardy\nA worthy knight, born in Pavia he,\nIn which he lived in great prosperity. And sixty years a wifeless man, was free To pursue all his bodily delight\nWith women, where lay his appetite,\nAs do these fools who are but secular.\nAnd when he had passed his sixtieth year, Whether from holiness, or in his dotage\nI cannot say, but he was in such a rage,\nThis knight, to see himself a wedded man That day and knight he ponders all he can Seeking for how he might wedded be, Praying Our Lord to grant him that he Might once know all of the blissful life\nThat is between a husband and his wife, And to live in that holy bond, tight bound, In which God first man and woman wound. ‘No other life,’ said he, ‘is worth a bean;\nFor wedlock is so comfortable, I mean, That in this world it seems a paradise.’\n– So said this old knight who was so wise.\nAnd certainly, as true as God is King,\nTo take a wife it is a glorious thing, Especially when a man is old and hoar; Then is a wife the fruit of all his hoard. Then should he take a wife young and fair,On whom he might engender an heir, And all his life in joy and solace pass, While all the bachelors may sing ‘alas!’ Where they are lost in the adversity\nOf love which is but childish vanity. And truly, it is fitting it should be so, And bachelors have all the pain and woe. On fragile base they build, fragility\nThey find when they would have security. They live but as a bird or as a beast,\nIn liberty and free of any leash,\nYet a wedded man in his new state\nLives a life blissful and moderate,\nUnder this yoke of true marriage bound.\nWell may his heart in joy and bliss abound;\nFor who shall be obedient as a wife?\nWho is so true, and caring of his life\nIn sickness and in health, as is his mate?\nFor weal or woe she will not him forsake,\nShe never wearies, but will love and serve, Though he lie bedridden while on this earth. And yet some scholars say it is not so,\nAnd Theophrastus he is one of those.\nWhat matter if Theophrastus choose to lie? ‘For thriftiness,’ quoth he, ‘take not a wife,\nIn order to spare your household from expense. A faithful servant will show more diligence\nIn nurturing your estate than your own wife, For she will claim a half of it all her life.\nAnd if you are sick, so God me save,\nYour true friends, or an honest knave,\nWill help you more than she that waits, I say\nTo own your goods, and has for many a day. And if you take a wife to have and hold,\nYou may easily end up as a cuckold.’\nThis opinion, and a hundred worse,\nWrites the man, may God his ashes curse!But ignore all such, it’s vanity;\nDefy Theophrastus, hearken unto me.\nA wife is God’s gift, say I, verily.\nAll other kinds of gift, assuredly –\nSuch as lands, rents, pasture, rights in common, Or movables – they are all gifts of Fortune, Which vanish like the shadows on a wall.\nBut doubt not, plainly I shall speak to all,\nA wife will last, and in your house endure, Longer then you may wish, peradventure!\nMarriage is a mighty sacrament;\nHe that has no wife is good as spent;\nHe lives helplessly and desolate –\nI speak of folk in the secular state.\nAnd listen why – I do not speak for naught – Because woman was for man’s help wrought. Great God, when he first Adam created,\nAnd saw him all alone, and belly-naked,\nGod of his goodness said, as He had planned: ‘Let us create a helpmate for this man,\nOne like himself’ – and then created Eve. Here may you see, and so may you believe,\nA wife is a man’s help and consolation,\nHis terrestrial paradise and salvation.\nSo obedient and virtuous is she,\nThey cannot help but live in unity.\nOne flesh are they, and one flesh, I guess, Has but one heart, in joy and in distress.\nA wife – ah, Saint Mary, benedicitee!\nHow should a man then know adversity Who has a wife? For sure, I cannot say.\nThe bliss between them both, night and day, No tongue can tell about nor heart can think. If he is poor, she labours, every wink;\nShe nurtures his goods, wastes not a shell. All that her husband likes, she likes as well. She never once says ‘nay’, when he says ‘yes’.‘Do this,’ says he, ‘all ready, sire,’ she says.\nO blissful order of true wedlock precious, You are so happy and so virtuous, Commended and approved, week by week, That every man that’s worth more than a leek, Upon his bare knees ought throughout his life To thank the God who sent to him a wife,\nOr else should pray to God that He might send A wife to him, to endure till his life end,\nFor then he can live life in security\nAnd not be troubled, as far as I can see,\nAs long as by his wife’s advice he’s led; Then may he boldly hold aloft his head. They are so true, and withal are so wise. Thus, if you’d live as learned men advise, Do always as the womenfolk shall cite.\nLo then, how Jacob, as the clerics write, By good counsel of his mother, Rebecca, Binds the kid’s skin round his neck, a Ploy by which his father’s blessing’s won.\nLo, how Judith, for thus the stories run, By wise counsel, God’s own people kept, And slew King Holofernes while he slept.\nLo, how by Abigail’s good counsel she Saved her own husband Nabal, when he Looked to be slain; and Esther, she also By good counsel delivered out of woe The people of God, and had Mordecai Enhanced by Ahasuerus in God’s eye.\nThere is no rank superior, in life, Says Seneca, to that of humble wife.\nEndure your wife’s tongue, as Cato has it; She shall command, and you must endure it – And yet she will obey out of courtesy.\nA wife is the keeper of your property;\nWell may the sick man wail and weep\nWhen there is no wife the house to keep.I warn you, if wisely you would work,\nLove your wife well, as Christ loved his Church. If you love yourself, then love your wife.\nNo man hates his flesh, but all his life\nHe nurtures it; and therefore bid I thee,\nCherish your wife, or never prosperous be. Husband and wife, whatever men jesting say, Among the worldly, keep to the safest way. They are so knit, no harm may thus abide,\nAnd especially upon the woman’s side.\nSo January considered, of whom I told,\nFor he, when the time came that he was old, Thought of the pleasant life, the virtuous quiet, That is marriage’s sweet and honeyed diet,\nAnd for his friends thus one day he sent\nTo tell them the gist of all his fond intent.\nWith grave face this tale to them he told: ‘Friends,’ he said, ‘see, I am hoar and old, And almost, God knows, on the grave’s brink; Now, of my soul somewhat I must think.\nI have my strength wantonly expended – Blessed be God that this may be amended! For I will, indeed, become a married man, And that anon, with all the haste I can.\nI’ll wed some maid, of fair and tender age,\nI pray you, prepare you for my marriage Swiftly now, for I cannot long abide.\nAnd I will try to discover, on my side,\nTo whom I might be wedded rapidly.\nBut since there are more of you than me,\nYou are more likely such a one to spy\nThan me, one with whom I might best ally.\nBut of one thing I warn you, my friends dear, I will have no old wife, no, never fear.\nShe shall not be more than twenty, say,\nOld fish but young flesh I’d have any day; Better a pike,’ quoth he, ‘than a pickerel,Yet fresh veal better than old beef is well. I’d wish for no woman thirty years of age; Such is but bedstraw and coarse for forage. And old widows, God knows that they float As trickily as did Wade’s fabled boat, Making so much mischief when they wish, That I’d never have a moment’s peace.\nFor as diverse schools make subtle clerics; Woman, of many schools, part-scholar is. But surely, a young thing men may guide, As warm wax in the hands, readily plied. Wherefore, I say plainly, in a single clause,\nI will have no old wife, and here’s the cause. For if it happened by some cruel mischance I would find no pleasure in her glance,\nAnd I’d end in adultery, by and by,\nAnd go straight to the devil when I die. No children on her should I then beget; And I’d prefer my hounds to eat me yet Rather than that my property should fall Into strange hands, and this I tell you all.\nI am not in my dotage; I know why\nMen should be wed, and furthermore I Know that many a man speaks of marriage That knows no more than does my page,\nOf why every man should take a wife –\nIf he cannot live chaste throughout his life – Take him a wife with proper devotion\nAnd for the sake of lawful procreation\nOf children, to the honour of God above, And not for passion only or for love;\nAnd so that he might lechery eschew,\nAnd pay his debt when it falls due;\nOr so that each should help the other\nIn misery, as a sister does her brother,\nAnd live in chastity full holily.\nBut, sires, that is not I, by your leave;For, God be thanked, I dare to boast,\nI feel my limbs stronger are than most, Enough to do all that a man may do.\nI know best myself what I can do, too. Though I am hoary, I am like a tree\nThat blossoms white before the fruit, we see, A blossoming tree is neither dry nor dead. And I am only hoary on my head.\nMy heart and all my limbs are as green\nAs laurel all the year is sweetly seen.\nAnd since you have heard all my intent,\nI pray that you will, to my wish, assent.’\nVarious men variously him told\nOf marriage, gave many examples old. Some blamed it, and some praised it again; But at the last, and briefly to explain,\nAs everyday occur fierce altercations Between friends in their disputations,\nA quarrel fell out between his friends so; Of whom the one was called Placebo, While Justinus, in truth, was the other.\nPlacebo said: ‘O January, my brother,\nYou have little need, my lord so dear,\nTo take counsel of anyone that’s here, Unless being so full of sapience,\nYou’d dislike, of your noble prudence,\nTo stray far from the words of Solomon. This is what he said to us, every one,\n“Work everything by counsel” – so said he – ‘And then you’ll not repent latterly.”\nBut though Solomon spoke this word, My own dear brother and my lord,\nGod in Heaven bring my soul to rest,\nI hold your own counsel still the best. For, brother mine, since opinion’s rife, Well, I have been a courtier all my life, And God knows, though I unworthy be,I have served with those of high degree, Amongst lords of the highest estate, Yet with them I never would debate.\nI never contradicted them, truly;\nI well know my lord knows more than me. Whatever he says, I hold it to be right;\nOn the same, or something similar, I light. A mighty fool is any councillor\nWho serves a lord with high honour,\nYet dares presume, or consider he is fit\nTo offer advice that betters his lord’s wit. No, lords are not fools, no, by my faith! You have shown yourself, here today\nOf such noble thought, so holy and fine, That I agree, endorse it all with mine,\nAll your words and all your true opinion. By God, there is no man in all this town, Nor in Italy, who could have spoken better! Christ would be satisfied with every letter. And truly it is a noble wish I say\nFor any man who is advanced in age\nTo take a young wife; by my father’s kin, Your heart’s hanging from a trusty pin!\nDo now in this matter as you wish,\nFor, in conclusion, I do think that best.’\nJustinus, who sat still and all this heard,\nIn this manner Placebo he answered:\n‘Now, my brother, be patient I pray,\nSince you have spoken, hear now what I say.\n‘Seneca, among other words, all wise,\nSays indeed that a man is well advised\nTo ponder where he leaves his land and chattels. And since therefore I ought to think right well To whom I give my goods away, truly\nI should consider still more carefully\nTo whom I give my body for many a day,\nI warn you truly now, it’s no child’s playTo marry without due consideration.\nMen must enquire – this is my opinion –\nIf she be wise, sober or drunken too,\nOr proud, or else otherwise a shrew,\nA chider, or a waster of your goods,\nRich or poor, a virago from the woods – Although it’s true as ever no man shall\nFind any in this world sound in all,\nNo man, no beast that man could devise.\nBut nonetheless, it ought to suffice\nFor any wife, that one know if she had\nMore good qualities than she had bad.\nAnd all this needs leisure to enquire.\nFor, God knows, I have wept tears entire Days, privately, since I have had a wife.\nPraise who will a married man’s life,\nBe sure, I find in it but cost and care,\nAnd duty, of all bliss and joy bare.\nAnd yet, God knows, my neighbours all about, And especially the women, I avow,\nSay that I have a most constant wife,\nAnd the meekest one that God gave life.\nBut I know best where pinches thus the shoe. You can do, for my part, what pleases you. Take thought – you are mature now in age – Before you enter into any marriage,\nEspecially with a wife both young and fair.\nBy Him that made water, earth, and air,\nThe youngest man there is among the crowd Is hard put to ensure, if he’s allowed,\nHis wife for himself alone. Trust in me,\nYou shall not please her fully years three – That is to say, or give her satisfaction.\nA wife demands plenty of attention.\nWith what I said, be not displeased I pray.’\n‘Well, quoth January, ‘have you had your say? That for your Seneca and your proverbs!I care not a basketful of herbs\nFor scholar’s terms! Wiser men than thou, As you know well, have assented now,\nTo my scheme. Placebo what say ye?’\n‘I say it is a cursed man,’ quoth he,\n‘Indeed, who hinders true matrimony.’\nAnd with that word they rose, suddenly,\nAnd they assented fully that he should\nBe wedded when he wished, and where he would.\nPowerful imaginings, fresh anxiousness, From day to day, full on the spirit pressed\nOf January, concerning all this marriage.\nMany a fair shape, many a fair visage,\nThere passed through his heart, night by night, As one who took a mirror, polished bright, And set it there in the public market-place, Would see many a reflected figure pace\nAcross his mirror; and in similar wise\nCould January in his own mind devise\nImages of maids who dwelt on every side.\nHe was unsure where preference should abide; For if the one had beauty in her face,\nAnother stood so in the people’s grace For her sobriety and benignity,\nThat in folk’s report most worth had she; And others were rich, but had a bad name. Nonetheless, between earnest and game, He, in the end, had fixed his mind on one, And every other from his heart was gone, And he chose her, on his own authority; For love is blind always, and cannot see. And when at night he his bed had sought, He portrayed her in his heart and thought, Her fresh beauty, and her age so tender, Her little waist, her arms long and slender, Her wise discipline, and her gentleness, Her womanly bearing and her soberness.And when to look on her he condescended,\nHe thought his choice could never be amended. For when all this he concluded had,\nHe thought every other man’s wits so bad,\nIt would be for them an impossibility\nTo contest his choice; that was his fantasy.\nHis friends he sent to on the instant,\nAnd begged them to honour his intent\nAsking them swiftly to him now to come;\nHe would abridge their labour, all and some. There was no further need for them to ride; He’d decided where his choice would abide.\nPlacebo came, his friends were all there soon, And first of all he begged of them a boon, That none should any ill contention make Against the decision that he chose to take; Which decision was pleasant to God, said he, And the very grounds of his prosperity.\nHe said there was a maiden in the town, Who for her beauty had won great renown, Although it chanced she was of low degree, It sufficed for him she had youth and beauty; Which maid, he said, he would take to wife, And lead in ease and holiness his life,\nAnd thanked God that he would have her all, And no man should share his bliss at all, And begged them to pander to his need, And make sure that his courtship succeed, For then, he said, his mind would be at ease. ‘There is,’ quoth he, ‘nothing to displease, Except one thing pricking in my conscience, The which I will rehearse in your presence.\nI have,’ quoth he, ‘heard said, a year ago, No man can have perfect bliss, in both – That is to say, in earth and then in heaven. For though he keep him from the sins seven, And from every branch, too, of that tree,Yet is there such perfect felicity\nAnd such great ease and joy in marriage,\nThat ever I am aghast now, at my age,\nThat I may lead now so merry a life, Luxurious, and free of woe and strife,\nThat I shall have my heaven on earth here. And yet since heaven indeed is bought so dear, With tribulation and with mighty penance, How should I then, living a life so pleasant,\nAs all married men do with their wives,\nCome to bliss where Christ eternal thrives? This is my dread; and you my brethren, say, You two, how to resolve this question, pray.’\nJustinus, who hated all such folly, Answered at once, in silent mockery;\nAnd as he would a longer tale abridge,\nHe would no clear authority allege,\nBut said: ‘Sire, if there’s no obstacle\nOther than this, God, by a miracle\nAnd of his mercy, may for you so work. That ere you have the rites of holy church You may repent of the married man’s life, In which you say there is no woe or strife. And God forbid He do ought but send\nThe married man the grace to repent\nMuch more often than the single man!\nAnd therefore, sire, the best advice I can Give you, despair not, but keep in memory That she perhaps may prove your purgatory. She may be God’s means, and God’s whip; Then shall your soul up to Heaven skip Swifter than does the arrow from the bow.\nI hope to God hereafter you may know That there is none so great a felicity\nIn marriage, nor nevermore shall be, That could deprive you of your salvation, Provided you use, with skill and reason,The pleasures of your wife, temperately, And that you please her not too amorously, And that you keep from every other sin. My advice is done, for my wits are thin.\nBe not aghast at it all, my brother dear, And let us turn from this matter here.\nThe Wife of Bath, if you can understand Her view of the business we’ve on hand, Has declared it clearly in little space. Farwell now; God have you in His grace.’\nAnd with that Justinus and his brother\nTook their leave, and each one of the other.\nFor when they saw that it needs must be,\nThey so wrought, by wise and cunning treaty, That this maiden, named fair May, she might\nAs swiftly as ever should appear right,\nBe wedded to this old man January.\nI think too long you’d need to tarry,\nIf I told you of every deed and bond\nBy which she was endowed with his land,\nOr to detail all her rich array.\nBut finally we reach the wedding day\nAnd to the church both of them now went There to receive the holy sacrament.\nForth the priest, with stole about his neck, there, And bade her be like Sarah and Rebecca,\nIn wisdom and in the truth of marriage,\nAnd said the orisons, in common usage,\nSigned them with the cross, and bade God bless, And made all sure enough with holiness.\nThus were they wedded with solemnity, And down to the feast sit he and she, With other worthy folk on the dais.\nAll full of joy and bliss is the place,\nAnd full of instruments, and plenty,\nThe most delicious food in all Italy.\nBefore them stood instruments whose soundWas such that Orpheus, nor Amphion\nEver made such a perfect melody.\nWith every course there came loud minstrelsy That never trumpet blared with Joab near, Nor Thiodomas, never was half so clear,\nAt Thebes when the city was in doubt. Bacchus himself poured wine all about,\nAnd Venus smiled sweetly at the sight,\nFor January had become her knight,\nAnd now would test out all his courage\nAs he had done in liberty, in marriage,\nAnd with her firebrand in her hand about, Danced before the bride and all the rout. And for sure, I dare in truth say this:\nHymen that the god of marriage is,\nNever saw so merry a married man.\nHold your peace, now, poet Marcian,\nWho describes that same wedding merry\nOf Philology the bride, to Mercury,\nAnd then writes the songs the Muses sung! Too shallow your pen, too weak your tongue, To tell the story of this marriage.\nWhen tender youth is wed to stooping age, There is such mirth it can’t be written.\nTry it yourself, and you’ll be bitten,\nTell me if I lie, in this matter here.\nMay sat: her looks were so benign and clear, To see her was to see the world of faery. Queen Esther never looked so meekly\nOn Ahasuerus, never such eye had she.\nI may not tell you of all her beauty;\nBut this much of her beauty tell I may, That she was like the bright morn of May, Filled with every beauty was her glance.\nOld January was ravished, in a trance Every time he looked upon her face. But in his mind he menaced her apaceWith how that night in his arms he’d strain Her tighter than Paris Helen did constrain. But nonetheless, he felt it a great pity\nThat he must offend her that night, and he Thought to himself: ‘Alas, O tender creature, Now would to God that you may endure\nAll my passion, so sharp and keen, again\nI am aghast lest you shall it not sustain. God forbid that I do all that I might! Would God though that it were truly night, And the night last for evermore, and so\nI wish these people were about to go!’\nAnd finally he set himself to labour\nAs best he could, while careful of his honour, To hasten them from the meal in subtle wise.\nThe moment came when it was time to rise, And after that they danced and drank, at last Spices all about the house they cast,\nAnd full of joy and bliss was every man –\nAll but a squire whose name was Damian,\nWho carved for the knight full many a day.\nHe was so taken with this lady May\nHe was nigh mad with the pains of love.\nHe almost swooned and fainted where he stood, So sore had Venus hurt him with her brand\nThat she bore, while she was dancing, in her hand. And took himself off to bed hastily;\nOf him no more at this time will I speak,\nBut leave him there to weep and to complain, Till fresh May shall take pity on his pain.\nO perilous fire, that in the bed-straw gathers! O household foe, who his ill service proffers! O treacherous servant, with false homely hue, An adder in the bosom, sly, untrue!\nGod shield us all from your base acquaintance. O January, drunken in the dance\nOf marriage, see how your DamianYour own squire, from birth that was your man, Intends to do you now some villainy.\nGod grant that this household foe you see!\nFor in this world there’s no worse pestilence Than a household foe daylong in your presence.\nPerfected had the sun his arc diurnal;\nNo longer might the body of him sojourn, All on the horizon in that latitude.\nNight with her mantle that is dark of hue Had overspread the hemisphere about,\nAt which departed all the merry rout\nOf guests, and with thanks on every side. Home to their houses merrily they ride, Where they do whatever they think best, And when it seems due time, take their rest.\nSoon after that, our restless January\nDesires his bed; he will no longer tarry.\nHe takes hippocras, and sweet wine laced\nWith spices hot, to make the spirits race,\nAnd many a potion drinks he, as fine\nAs those the cursed monk Constantine,\nHas written of in his book De Coitu;\nHe quaffed them all and nothing did eschew. And to his private friends thus said he:\n‘For God’s love, as soon as it may be,\nHave the house cleared in courteous wise.’\nAnd they did exactly as he did advise;\nMen drank a toast, the curtains then were drawn, The bride was brought abed, as still as stone;\nAnd when the bed had by the priest been blessed, Out of the chamber everybody pressed.\nAnd January fast in his arms did take\nHis fresh May, his paradise, his mate.\nHe calms her, he kisses her full oft;\nAnd with the bristles of his beard un-soft, Like to dog-fish scales, and sharp as briars – For he has freshly shaved as it transpires –He rubs her all about her tender face,\nAnd says thus: ‘Alas, my spouse, for a space I must injure you, and greatly you offend, Before the morning when we shall descend.\nBut nonetheless, consider this,’ quoth he, ‘There is no workman, whosoever he be, That can work well, and also hurriedly. This must be done at leisure, carefully.\nIt matters not now how long now we play; Coupled in wedlock were we two today And blessed be the yoke that we are in, For in our actions we can do no sin.\nA man can commit no sin with his wife,\nNo more than hurt himself with his own knife, For we have leave to play, so says the law.’\nThus he laboured till daylight, as before,\nAnd then he took some bread in spiced wine, And upright in his bed sat so to dine,\nAnd after that he sang out loud and clear,\nAnd kissed his wife, and wanton did appear.\nHe was all coltish, folly in his eye,\nAnd full of chatter as a pert magpie.\nThe slack of skin below his neck did shake While he chanted, bawled, and song did make. God knows what poor May thought in her heart, When she saw him in his shirt upstart,\nAnd in his night-cap, with his neck all lean;\nShe thought his dalliance not worth a bean.\nThen said he thus: ‘My rest shall I take\nNow day is come; I cannot keep awake.\nAnd down he laid his head and slept till prime. And afterward, when he thought it time,\nUp rose January; but fresh May\nKept to her chamber till the fourth day,\nAs wives do, they think it for the best.\nFor every labourer must sometimes rest,\nOr else the labour may not long endure –\nThat is to say, of any living creature, Be it of fish or bird or beast or man.\nNow will I speak of woeful Damian, Who languishes for love, as you shall hear. Therefore I’d speak to him in this manner: I’d say: ‘O foolish Damian, alas!\nAnswer my question, in this pretty pass: How shall you to your lady, fresh May, Tell your woe? She will ever say you nay. And if you speak she will your woe betray. God be your help! That’s all that I can say.’\nThis sick-hearted Damian in Venus’ fire So burned that he was dying of desire, And so he chose to put his life at venture. No longer could he in this wise endure; But secretly a pen-case he did borrow, And in a letter wrote out all his sorrow, In the form of a plaint or of a lay\nUnto his fair and fresh lady May. And in a purse of silk hung it with art Inside his shirt, laid against his heart.\nThe moon in two degrees, at noon, the day That January wedded his fresh May,\nOf Taurus, into Cancer now had ridden\nSo long had May in her chamber hidden,\nAs is the custom with these nobles all.\nA bride should never eat in the hall\nUntil four days, or three at the least\nHave passed; then she may go and feast.\nThe fourth day complete from noon to noon, When the high Mass was over and done,\nIn the hall sat January and May,\nAs fresh as is the bright summer’s day. And so it befell that this good man Recalled his faithful squire Damian, And said: ‘Saint Mary, how may this be, That Damian attends not here on me?\nIs he sick, or what else may betide?’\nHis squires, who stood there by his side, Excused him on the grounds of sickness, Which excluded him from any business; No other cause would make him tarry.\n‘Sorry I am for that,’ quoth January,\n‘He is a noble squire, a gentle youth.\nIf he should die, ‘twere pity then, in truth. He is as wise, as secret and discrete\nAs any of his rank whom you may meet, And courteous too, willing to serve at table, And to be a worthy man he is right able. But after meat, as soon as ever I may,\nI will visit him myself, and so shall May,\nTo give him all the comfort that I can.’ And, at his words, blessed him every man, That of his nobility and his kindness\nHe would go comfort in his sickness\nHis squire, for it was a gentle deed.\n‘Dame,’ quoth this January, ‘take good heed, That after meat you, with your women all, When you reach your chamber from this hall, Go along and see our Damian.\nAnd entertain him; he’s a gentleman.\nAnd tell him I shall pay him a visit,\nWhen I have rested for a little bit.\nAnd speed you fast, for I will abide\nUntil you sleep soundly by my side.’\nAnd with those words he began to call\nFor the squire who was marshal of his hall, And told him certain things that he wished.\nFresh May straight made her way after this, With all her women, to see Damian.\nDown by his bed she sat, and began\nTo comfort him as well as she may. Damian, saw his chance, as there he lay, And secretly his purse and his petition,In which he had told of his condition,\nHe put into her hand with nothing more Than a sigh both wondrous deep and sore, And softly, to her, right thus said he:\n‘Mercy, and do thou not expose me,\nFor I am dead if this thing be espied!’\nThe purse she does in her bosom hide,\nAnd goes her way – of that no more from me! But unto January comes she finally,\nWho on his bedside sits full soft\nAnd clasps her then and kisses her full oft, Then lays him down to sleep, and that anon. She pretended she must needs be gone\nWhere everyone we know must go at need. And when she of the note had taken heed, She rent it all to pieces at the last,\nAnd into the privy softly did it cast.\nWho deliberates but fair fresh May?\nAdown by old January she lay,\nWho slept till his cough woke him abed.\nThen he begged her strip herself naked;\nHe would, he said, take pleasure at a chance; And said he found her clothes an encumbrance. And she obeyed, whether she would or not. But lest prudish folk be me with wrath,\nHow that he wrought, that I dare not tell, Nor whether she thought it paradise or hell, But here I leave them working in their wise, Till evensong when they were due to rise.\nWhether by destiny, or at a venture,\nBy starry influence, or merely nature,\nOr by some configuration of aspects straight, The heavens then appeared more fortunate To present petitions full of Venus’ works – For each thing has its time, so say the clerks – To any woman to obtain her love,\nI cannot say; but the great God above,Who knows that no event is causeless,\nLet Him judge all, for my pen will rest.\nBut true it is, that on our fresh May\nSuch was the impression made that day\nBy him, and by her pity for Damian,\nThat from her heart there is no way she can Drive out the need to do him ease.\n‘And then,’ she thought, ‘whoever it displease, I care not; for I shall him assure\nThat I will love him best of any creature Though but his shirt has he, at the start.’\nLo, pity swiftly flows in gentle heart! Here may you see the generosity\nOf woman, when she ponders carefully.\nSome there may be, many such are known, Tyrants with a heart as hard as stone,\nThat would have seen him perish in that place, Rather than granting him a moment’s grace, And rejoiced then in their cruel pride,\nCareless of being thought a homicide. But gentle May, filled full of pity,\nIn her own hand a letter wrote she,\nIn which she granted him her true grace. There only lacked the time and place,\nThat might, to satisfy his wish, suffice;\nFor it must be just as he would devise.\nAnd when she saw her chance one day,\nTo visit our Damian went May,\nAnd surreptitiously the letter thrust\nUnder his pillow – read it then he must.\nShe took him by the hand and gave a squeeze, So secretly that no one else could see,\nAnd bade him be well; and off she went\nTo January when for her he sent.\nUp rose Damian the next morrow;\nAll past was his sickness and his sorrow.\nHe combed his hair; groomed himself and dressed;He did all that his lady might like best.\nAnd then to January as meek does go\nAs ever a dog following the bow.\nHe is so pleasant to every man –\nBeing sly does all, for those who can –\nThat everyone spoke well of him, who should, And fully in his lady’s grace he stood.\nThus I leave Damian, busy with his need, And in my tale forth I will proceed.\nSome scholars hold that felicity\nConsists in pleasure, and certainly,\nThis noble January, with all his might,\nIn honest ways, as became a knight,\nSet out to live most luxuriously.\nHis household, his dress, was as finely Tailored to his degree as is a king’s.\nAnd amongst the rest of his fine things,\nHe had a garden, walled all with stone;\nSo fair a one, I’d say, was never known.\nFor sure, I would not easily suppose\nThat he who wrote the Romance of the Rose Could capture its beauty to the life;\nNor would Priapus himself suffice,\nThough he is god of gardens, to tell\nThe beauty of that garden, and the well\nThat stood beneath a laurel, always green. Many a time had Pluto and his Queen Proserpina, and all her band of faery, Sported there and made their melody\nAbout the well, and danced, or so men hold.\nThis noble knight, January the old,\nTook such delight in walking there, that he Would suffer no one else to have the key Save he himself; for of the small wicket\nHe bore the silver key that would unlock it, Which, when he wished, he often did do. And when he would pleasure his wife too,In summer season, thither would he go, With May his wife, so none would know. And anything they had not done in bed, Was done in the garden there instead. And in this wise many a merry day\nLived this January and fresh May.\nBut worldly joy may not always endure, For January, or for any other creature.\nO sudden chance, O Fortune the unstable, Like the scorpion endlessly deceitful,\nFeigning with your head when you would sting, Your tail is death, through your envenoming! O fragile joy, O sweet venom’s taint!\nO Monster that so subtly can paint\nYour gifts with the hue of steadfastness, So that you deceive both great and less! Why have you January thus deceived?\nYou had him as your true friend received, And now have bereft him of his sight – For sorrow of which he would die tonight.\nAlas, noble January, the worthy,\nAmidst his pleasure and prosperity\nIs stone blind, and that quite suddenly.\nHe weeps and he wails piteously;\nAnd with it comes the fire of jealousy,\nLest his wife should fall into some folly, That so burns his heart he would again Prefer some man both her and him had slain. For neither after his death nor in his life Would he have her a lover or a wife,\nBut as a widow live, clothes black as fate, Solitary as the dove that’s lost its mate.\nBut after a month or two had passed away, His sorrow began to ease, truth to say.\nFor when he saw that nothing else could be, In patience he accepted adversity;\nSave that, indeed, he had not foregoneHis jealousy: in that all days seemed one. Which jealousy of his was so outrageous That not to the hall, or any other house, Nor to any other place here below, Would he suffer her to ride or go\nUnless he had his hand on her always.\nAt which treatment often wept fresh May, Who loved Damian so graciously,\nThat she must either die suddenly,\nOr else must have him: at the worst, She thought her very heart would burst!\nAnd on his side, Damian was then\nOne of the most sorrowful of men,\nThat ever was, for neither night nor day, Might he speak one word to his fresh May, And as to his purpose no such matter,\nFor January would overhear their chatter, Who had his hand upon her, as you know. Yet nonetheless, by writing to and fro, And secret signs, he knew what she meant, And she knew too the gist of his intent.\nO January, what would it you avail Though you could see as far as a ship’s sail? As well be blind, and then deceived be\nAs be deceived when the eye can see.\nLo, Argus, who had a hundred eyes,\nFor all that ever he could peer or pry,\nYet was he blind; and many more, God knows, Who thought for certain that it was not so.\nI’ll pass on, in relief, and say no more.\nFresh May, whom I’ve spoken of before, In warm wax impressed the key, her mate Old January carried, of the little gate\nBy which into his garden he oft went. And Damian, who knew all her intent, Forged a counterfeit, all secretly.\nThere is no more to say, but presentlyA wonder will occur thanks to this gate, That you shall hear about, if you will wait.\nO noble Ovid, you spoke true, God knows! What stratagem is there, despite its woes\nLove will not in its own way discover?\nIn Pyramas and Thisbe see the manner:\nThough they were strictly watched overall,\nThey made a plan, by whispering through a wall, No one could have guessed their cunning ways.\nBut to our purpose now: before eight days\nHad passed, ere the month of June, it befell, January so desired – his wife did well\nFor she had egged him on – to go and play,\nIn the garden, and no one there but they,\nThat one morning unto his May said he:\n‘Rise up, my wife, my love, my lady free!\nHear the turtle-dove, my sweet, my pet,\nWinter is gone with all its cold and wet.\nCome forth, now, with those dove’s eyes of thine! How much more lovely are your breasts than wine! The garden is enclosed all about;\nCome forth my white spouse! Out of doubt, You have wounded me in my heart, O wife; There is no stain on you, on my life.\nCome forth, and let us enjoy our sport;\nI chose you for my wife, and my comfort.’\n– Lewd words, from an ancient text, used he.\nTo Damian a signal then made she\nThat he should go before them and wait. So Damian went and opened up the gate, And in he slid, and that in such a manner That no one saw him, or heard him, there; And he sat still, under a bush, alone.\nOld January, as blind as is a stone, Holding May’s hand, and walking so, Into the fresh garden he did go,\nAnd clapped the wicket to, and firmly.‘Now wife,’ quoth he, ‘here’s only you and me, You are the creature that I best love.\nFor, by the Lord that sits in Heaven above,\nI would rather perish by the knife,\nThan offend you, my true dear wife!\nFor God’s sake, consider how I chose\nYou, not from covetousness, suppose,\nBut only for the love I bore to thee.\nAnd though I am old and cannot see,\nBe true to me, and I will tell you why.\nThree things, surely, shall you win thereby: First, love of Christ, and to yourself honour, And all my property, of town and tower,\nI give you – draw the deeds up, as is best, We’ll sign tomorrow, ere sun goes to rest, As God Himself may bring my soul to bliss! I pray that first, to seal it, you me kiss.\nAnd though I may be jealous, blame me not; You are so deep imprinted in my thought That when I consider of your beauty,\nAnd then the ill-matched age of me,\nI may not, for certain, though it kill me, Bear to be out of your company\nFor love, indeed; I say without a doubt. Now kiss me wife, and let us roam about.’\nFresh May, when she these words heard, Graciously January she then answered;\nBut first and foremost she began to weep. ‘I have,’ quoth she, ‘a soul from sin to keep As well as you, and also my own honour, And of my wifehood too the tender flower. Which that I entrusted to your hand,\nWhen the priest to you my body bound. Wherefore I will answer in this manner, By your leave, I pray, my lord so dear:\nI pray to God that never dawns the day Or may I die as foul as woman may,That ever I bring my kin that shame, Or else so impair my own good name As to be false; and if I do, alack,\nStrip me then and put me in a sack, And in the next river do me drench.\nI am a gentlewoman and no wench!\nWhy speak you so? – But men are ever untrue, And women are forever blamed by you. You’ve no other way of speech, I believe,\nBut talk distrust, reproach to us, to grieve.’\nAnd as she spoke, she saw where Damian, Sat in the bushes, and coughing she began, With her fingers, to make signs, that she Wished Damian to climb into a tree\nWhich was charged with fruit, and up he went; For truly he knew all of her intent,\nAnd every sign she made, as I relate,\nBetter than January who was her mate,\nFor in a letter she had told him all,\nOf this matter, and how it might befall.\nAnd thus I leave him sitting in the pear-tree, And January and May roaming merrily.\nBright was the day, and blue the firmament; Phoebus his streams of gold downward sent To gladden every flower with his warmness. He was at that time in Gemini, I guess,\nBut little way from greatest declination In Cancer which is Jupiter’s exaltation. And so it befell, that bright morning-tide, That in that garden on the farther side Pluto, who is the King of Faery,\nAnd many a lady of his company, Following his wife, Queen Proserpina, Whom he once ravished out of Etna, While she gathered flowers in the mead – In Claudian the story you may read,\nHow in his dreadful chariot he her snatched –This King of Faery then adown him sat Upon a bench of turf, fresh and green. And right anon thus said he to his Queen:\n‘My wife,’ quoth he, ‘no one can gainsay, For experience proves it so, every day, The treachery that woman shows to man. Ten hundred thousand tales tell I can, Recorded, of your untruth and lightness. O Solomon, wise and richest in riches, Full of sapience and worldly glory,\nYour words are fit to be held in memory, By every man of wit, who reason can! Thus you praised the goodness of man: “Among a thousand men I yet found one, But among women all I found none.”\n– So says the king who knew your wickedness. And Jesus, Son of Sirach, I suggest,\nSeldom says aught of you in reverence.\nA wild fire and corrupting pestilence\nFall upon your bodies then tonight!\nSee you not how this honourable knight, Because, alas, he is now blind and old,\nHis own servant shall render him cuckold? Look, where he sits, the lecher in the tree! Now will I grant, of my great majesty, Unto this old, blind, worthy knight,\nThat he shall have again his true eyesight, And when his wife would do him villainy. Thus shall he know all of her harlotry, Both a reproach to her, and others woe.’\n‘You will?’ quoth Proserpine, ‘And will you so? Now by my mother’s sire’s soul I swear,\nThat I shall give her sufficient answer here,\nAnd every woman after, for her sake –\nAnd though they be caught in their mistake, With bold face their guilt they shall excuse, And bear him down who would them accuse.For lack of answer none of them shall die. Though a man see it with his naked eye, Yet shall we women outface him boldly, And weep, and swear, and scold subtly, So that men look as foolish as do geese.\nWhat care I for your authorities?\nI know well that this Jew, this Solomon, Found fools among us women, many a one. But though he discovered no good woman, Yet were there found by many another man Women true, and good, and virtuous. Witness all those that dwell in Christ’s house: With martyrdom they proved their constancy. The Roman tales preserve the memory\nOf many a true and constant wife also.\nBut sire, be not wrath though it be so, Though he said he found no good woman;\nI pray you, know the meaning of the man:\nHe meant thus, that supreme constancy Belongs to God alone, not he or she.\nAy, for God indeed why take such a one,\nAnd make so much of your Solomon?\nWhat though he made a Temple, God’s House? What though he were rich and glorious?\nThus made he a temple for the false gods! What could he do that more outrageous was? Oh, though you may whiten him with plaster, He was a lecher still, and an idolater,\nAnd in his old age he the Lord forsook.\nAnd if God had not, so says the Book,\nSpared him for his father’s sake, he would Have lost his kingdom sooner than he should.\nI set at naught all the villainy you cry\nOf women, it’s not worth a butterfly!\nI am a woman; and must have my say,\nOr else I’ll swell till my heart shall break.\nFor since he has said we’re villainesses,As ever I shall live to shake my tresses,\nI shall not refrain, out of false courtesy To speak him harm that does us villainy.’\n‘Dame,’ quoth Pluto, ‘be no longer wrath; I yield! But since I swore a sacred oath That I would grant him his sight again,\nMy word shall stand: this I tell you plain.\nI am a king; it is not meet I lie.’\n‘And’ quoth she, ‘the Queen of Faery, I!\nAn answer shall she have, I’ll undertake. Let us have no more words, for my sake; For now I will no longer be contrary.’\nSo let us turn again to January,\nWho in the garden still with his fair May Sings more merrily than a popinjay,\n‘You love I best, and shall, and other none.’ So long about the alleys is he gone\nTill he is come again to that pear-tree Where Damian is sitting merrily,\nOn high among the fresh leaves so green.\nAnd then fresh May, the bright and serene, Began to sigh, and said: ‘Alas, my side! Now, sire,’ quoth she, ‘whatever may betide, I must have one of the pears I see,\nOr I must die; I long so utterly\nTo eat one of those small pears, so green. Help, for Her love that is of Heaven Queen! I tell you, sire, a woman in my plight\nMay have for fruit so great an appetite,\nThat without it she’ll go to her grave.’\n‘Alas!’ quoth he, ‘that I have not a knave\nTo climb up, here! Alas! Alas! quoth he,\n‘That I am blind.’ ‘No matter, sire,’ quoth she; ‘Yet if you’d vouchsafe, for God’s sake,\nThe pear-tree now in your arms to take –\nFor I know well how you mistrust me –\nThen I could climb it well enough,’ quoth she,‘If I could set my foot upon your back.’ ‘Certainly,’ quoth he, ‘you shall not lack,\nHad I to aid you with my own heart’s-blood.’ He stooped down, and on his back she stood, And caught hold of a branch, and up she goes – Ladies, I pray you, be not wrath, suppose\nMe uncultured, I speak as best I can – And suddenly anon, this Damian Pulls up her smock, and in he’s gone.\nAnd when Pluto saw this shameful wrong, To January he gave again his sight,\nAnd let him see as plain as ever he might. And when he had his vision back again, Never was man more happy, that is plain. But on his wife his thought was fixed too; And up to the tree he cast his eyes two, And saw that Damian his wife addressed\nIn such a manner it may not be expressed, Unless I were to speak discourteously.\nHe gave a roar and shouted out as loudly, As a mother does if a child should die. ‘Out, help! Rape! Alas!’ he began to cry, ‘O brazen lady bold, what do you do?’\nAnd she answered: ‘Sire, what troubles you? Be patient and be rational of mind.\nI’ve helped to doctor both your eyes blind; On peril of my soul, without a lie,\nI was told that for healing of the eye Nothing was better: it would make you see, If I struggled with a man up in a tree.\nGod knows, I did it all with good intent.’\n‘Struggle!’ quoth he, ‘yes, and in it went! God send you both a shameful death to die! He had you: I saw it clearly with my eye, Let me be hanged by the neck or else!’ ‘Then,’ quoth she, ‘is my remedy false;\nFor certainly if you could truly see,You would not utter these same words to me. You have some vision, yet not perfect sight.’\n‘I see,’ quoth he, ‘as well as ever I might, Thanks be to God, with both my eyes so! And by my troth, I think he did you though.’ ‘You’re dazed, dazed, good sire,’ quoth she, ‘These are the thanks for curing you, I see! Alas,’ quoth she, ‘that ever I proved so kind!’\n‘Well dame,’ quoth he, ‘erase it from your mind. Come down, my love, and if I may have said Aught wrong, God help me, forgive instead.\nBut by my father’s soul I thought I saw\nThat Damian enjoy you, and what’s more\nYour smock was gathered round your breast.’ ‘You, sire,’ quoth she, ‘may think as suits you best. But sire, a man that wakes out of his sleep, Cannot grasp all at once the things he sees,\nAnd cannot see what he looks on perfectly,\nUntil he has awakened more completely.\nAnd so a man that has been blind, well he\nMay not all at once, nor clearly, see\nWhen his new sight has first come again,\nAs he that has a day or two seen plain.\nTill your sight has settled for a while,\nFull many a sight may you still beguile.\nBe careful, I pray, by Heaven’s King,\nMany a man believes he sees a thing,\nAnd finds it different to what it seems.\nHe who misperceives, chases dreams.’\n– And with that she leaped down from the tree.\nAnd January, who so glad as he?\nHe kissed her, embracing her full oft,\nAnd her belly stroked he then full soft,\nAnd to the house he lead her then, I’ll add. Now good men, I pray you all be glad;\nThus ends here my tale of January;\nGod bless us, and his mother too, Saint Mary!",
	"Canterbury Tales: \n\t The Franklin's Tale": "In Armorica, now called Brittany,\nThere was a knight that loved, and truly he Strove to serve his lady in best wise.\nAnd many a labour, many an enterprise He for his lady wrought ere she was won;\nFor she was among the fairest under the sun, And also she came of such a high kindred That the knight scarcely dared, for dread\nTo tell her of his woe, pain, and distress.\nBut at the last, seeing his worthiness,\nAnd especially his humble obeisance,\nShe took such pity on his true penance That privately they entered in accord,\nShe to make him her husband and her lord, With such lordship as men have over wives. And to live in greater bliss all their lives,\nOf his free will he swore to her as knight That never in all his life, day or night, Would he take upon himself the mastery Against her will, nor show her jealousy, But obey her, and follow her will in all, As any lover in his lady’s thrall;\nSave that the name alone of sovereignty Should he have, lest it shame his dignity.\nShe thanked him, and with full great humbleness She said: ‘Sire, since, of your gentleness,\nYou’ll allow me to have so great a rein,May God grant that never between us twain, Through guilt of mine, be any war or strife. Sire, I will be your humble loyal wife;\nOr may my heart break first, such is my pledge. Thus were they both in quiet and at rest.\nFor one thing, goods sirs, I may safely say, That lovers must one another fast obey,\nIf they’d keep company for many a day. Love will not be constrained by mastery; When mastery comes, the God of Love anon Beats his wings, and farewell, he is gone! Love is a thing as any spirit free.\nWomen, by nature, wish for liberty,\nAnd not to be constrained, as in thrall,\nAnd so do men, and truth is this for all.\nLook who is most patient in their love,\nHas the advantage and so towers above. Patience is a high virtue, that’s certain,\nFor it achieves, as clerics do maintain,\nThings that force is unable to attain.\nAt every word we must not chide, complain; Learn to accept, or else, for here below,\nYou shall learn, whether you will or no.\nAnd in this world, indeed, no one exists\nWho does not sometimes speak a word amiss. Ire, sickness, or the stars’ configuration, Wine, woe, or our humours’ alteration\nOften gives cause to do amiss or speak. Revenge for every wrong may no man wreak; According to the time, act with temperance All you that understand good governance. And therefore had this wise and noble knight, Sworn patience, so as to live at ease, aright, And she to him as earnestly did swear\nThat he should never find a fault in her.\nHere may men see a humble, wise accord! Thus she makes him her servant and her lord –Servant in love, and yet her lord in marriage; Thus was he both in lordship and in bondage. Bondage? – Nay, in lordship high above, Since he had both his lady and his love;\nHis lady, certain, and his wife also,\nWhich the law of love accords with, though. And now he had met with such prosperity,\nHome with his wife he went to his country, Not far from Penmarch Point, his dwelling was, Where he lived in bliss and in solace.\nWho can know, unless he wedded be,\nThe joy, the ease, and the prosperity\nThat is between a husband and a wife?\nA year and more lasted this blissful life,\nTill the knight whose story I discuss,\nOf Caer-rhud, and called Arveragus, Determined to go and live a year or twain,\nIn England, that was also called Britain,\nTo seek in arms both worship and honour, For all his pleasure won he from such labour, And dwelt there two years; the book says thus.\nNow I’ll cease to speak of Arveragus,\nAnd I will speak of Dorigen his wife,\nThat loved her husband as her heart’s life.\nAt his absence she wept sore and sighed,\nAs does when she will the noblest bride.\nShe mourned, waked, wailed, fasted, cried;\nWhile longing for his presence thus denied,\nSo that all this wide world she set at naught.\nHer friends, who knew the burden of her thought, Comforted her, when they could, in every way. They preached at her, telling her night and day, That she was killing herself, in vain, alas!\nAnd every comfort possible that was Useful they gave, made it all their business, To try and put and end to her heaviness.\nBy a slow process, known to everyone,Men may carve away so long in stone\nThat some figure may thus imprinted be.\nSo long had they comforted her that she Received, through hope and through reason, The imprint of their endless consolation, And they began her sorrow to assuage;\nShe must not always let her feelings rage.\nAnd Arveragus, amongst all this care,\nHad sent letters, speaking of his welfare, And how he would return swiftly again; Else this sorrow would her heart have slain.\nHer friends saw her sorrow start to abate, And begged her on their knees, for God’s sake, To come and roam about in company,\nTo drive away her gloomy fantasy.\nAnd finally she granted their request,\nBecause she saw that it was for the best.\nNow, her castle stood close by the sea,\nAnd often with her friends wandered she,\nTo take her pleasure, on a bank full high,\nWhere she saw many a ship and barge go by, Sailing their course, wherever they chanced to go. But that too was a portion of her woe,\nFor to herself, full oft, ‘Alas!’ said she,\n‘Is there no ship, of all these that I see,\nWill bring me my lord again? Then my heart Would be cured of bitter sorrow’s smart.’\nAt other times she would sit and think,\nAnd cast her eyes downward from the brink.\nYet when she saw the ghastly rocks all black,\nFor fear indeed her heart would almost crack, On her feet she could scarce herself maintain. Then would she sit upon the grass again,\nAnd piteously the flowing tide behold,\nAnd speak as thus, with sorrowful sighs cold:\n‘Eternal God that through your providence Lead the world in certain governance,You made nothing in vain and yet, alack, Lord, these fiendish, grisly rocks all black, That seem to me rather a foul confusion In their work, than any fair creation\nOf such a wise and perfect God, thus able,\nWhy have you wrought this work unreasonable? For by this work, south, north, west or east\nThere is nurtured neither man nor beast.\nIt does no good, to my mind, but annoys.\nSee you not, Lord, how mankind it destroys?\nA hundred thousand souls, among mankind These rocks have slain, no more brought to mind; Yet mankind’s so fair a portion of your work\nYou made it in your image, says the clerk.\nThus it seems you had both love and charity Towards mankind; so how then may it be\nThat you created such means to destroy?\n– Which do no good, but evermore annoy.\nI know, indeed, that clerics will attest,\nTo arguments, that show all’s for the best, Though what the reasons are I do not know. But may the God that made the winds to blow Keep safe my lord! – That is my conclusion. To clerks I leave all the disputation.\nBut would to God that all these rocks so black Were sunken into Hell, and came not back, For his sake, they slay my heart with fear!’\n– Thus she did say, with many a piteous tear.\nHer friends could see she derived no sport Roaming by the sea, but pure discomfort,\nAnd chose to take their pleasure somewhere else. They led her among rivers, and by wells,\nAnd through other places all delightful;\nDanced, played chess, backgammon, to be helpful.\nSo one day, right in the morning-tide, Unto a garden that was there beside,\nInto which had been taken as they plannedVictuals and other things at their command, They went to sport and play the livelong day. And this was on the sixth morn in May,\nWhen May had painted with his softest showers The garden, filled with leaves and with flowers; And man’s handicraft so skilfully\nArrayed had all this garden, truthfully,\nThat never was there a garden so prized, Unless it were the ancient Paradise.\nThe odour of flowers and the fresh sight Would have rendered any heart light\nThat ever was born, unless some great sickness Or great sorrow consumed it with distress,\nSo full it was of beauty and elegance.\nAnd after dinner they began to dance\nAnd sing as well, save Dorigen alone,\nWho ever made plaint, and ever made moan, For in the dance she saw not him below, Who was her husband and her love also.\nBut nonetheless she must a while abide, Be of good hope, and let her sorrow slide.\nNow in this dance, among the other men, There pranced a squire before Dorigen, Who fresher was and jollier in array,\nAs I do live, than is the month of May.\nHe sang and danced better than any man,\nThat is, or was, since ever the world began.\nAnd then he was, if I should him describe,\nOne of the handsomest of men alive;\nYoung, strong, right virtuous, and rich and wise, And well beloved, considered a great prize.\nAnd briefly, truth to tell, as I recall, Unbeknown to Dorigen at all,\nThis gallant squire, a servant true of Venus, Who by name was called Aurelius,\nHad loved her the best of any creature,\nAs was his fate, for two years and more,But never dared proclaim his suffering;\nHe drank his sorrow straight from the spring.\nHe had despaired; nothing he dared say,\nSave in his songs something he’d convey\nOf all his woe, while generally lamenting.\nHe said he loved, but was beloved by nothing.\nOf such matter he made many lays,\nSongs, plaints, rondeaux and virelais,\nHow that he dare not of his sorrow tell,\nBut languished as a Fury does in Hell;\nAnd die he must, he said, as did Echo,\nFor Narcissus, who dared not tell her woe.\nIn no other manner than this, as I say,\nDare he to her his woe at all betray;\nSave that, perhaps, sometimes at a dance,\nWhere the young folk will keep observance,\nIt may well be he looked upon her face\nIn such a manner as man asks for grace,\nThough she knew nothing of his intent. Nonetheless, it chanced, ere they went thence, Because he happened to be her neighbour,\nAnd was a man of good repute and honour,\nAnd she had known him some time before,\nThey fell to talking, and more and more\nTowards his purpose drew Aurelius.\nAnd when he saw his chance, he spoke up thus: ‘Madame,’ quoth he, ‘by God who this world made, If I had known your heart felt no dismay,\nI wish that day when your Arveragus\nCrossed the sea, that I, Aurelius,\nHad gone too, never to return again.\nFor I see now my service is but vain;\nMy reward is but the breaking of my heart. Madame, have pity on my bitter smart,\nFor with a word you may me slay or save.\nHere at your feet, would God, they dug my grave!I have no time to say what I would say; Have mercy, sweet, or death is mine today.’\nShe began to stare at Aurelius.\n‘Is that your thought,’ quoth she, ‘and say you thus? Never have I suspected what you meant.\nBut now, Aurelius, knowing your intent,\nBy that God who gave me soul and life,\nKnow, I shall never play the faithless wife\nIn word or deed, as far as I have wit;\nI will be his to whom I have been knit.\nTake that for a final answer now from me.’\nBut after it teasingly thus said she:\n‘Aurelius, by the high God above,\nAs I wish I might have been your love, Since I hear you so piteously complain.\nLo, that day when from Brittany’s main, You remove every reef, stone by stone,\nSo no ship is hampered through that zone – I say, when the coast is rendered so clean Of rocks, that never a stone can be seen – Then I will love you more than any man. Hear my truth said, as plainly as I can.’\n‘Is there no better grace in you?’ quoth he.\n‘No, by the Lord,’ quoth she, ‘who fashioned me, For I know full well it shall never betide.\nLet such folly out of your heart slide!\nWhat pleasure is added thus to a man’s life\nIn making love to another man’s wife,\nWho can have her body when he will?\nAurelius was ever in deeps sighs still; Woe was Aurelieus, when this he heard, And with sorrowful heart he answered her: ‘Madame, to lose you is impossible!\nSo let death come, sudden and horrible.’\n– And with that he turned away anon.\nHer other friends appeared, many a one, And in the alleyways roamed up and down,Knowing nothing of this sad conclusion. And suddenly the revels began anew,\nTill the bright sun had lost his yellow hue, Since the horizon robbed them of his light – Which is as much as to say, that it was night. And home they went, in joy and in solace, Save only poor Aurelius, alas!\nHe to his house has gone, with sorrowful heart. That he and death shall not be long apart,\nHe feels, and senses his heart grow cold.\nUp to the heavens he his hands does hold,\nOn his bare knees then he sets him down, And in a rage of feeling says his orison.\nFor woe his wits were addled in his head;\nHe knew not what he spoke, but thus he said. With piteous heart his plaint was thus begun Unto the gods, and first unto the sun.\n‘Apollo,’ said he, ‘God and governor\nOf every plant, and herb, tree and flower, Who gives, according to your declination, To each of them its time and season,\nAs your position changes, low or high,\nLord Phoebus, cast now your merciful eye On sad Aurelius, wretched and forlorn!\nLo, Lord, my lady now my death has sworn Though I am guiltless, your benignity\nUpon my doomed heart may yet take pity. For I know, Lord Phoebus, if you wished, You, save for my lady, could help me best. Now vouchsafe me that I might advise\nYou how I may be helped, and in what wise.\nLuna, your sister blest, who bright does sheen, And of the sea is chief goddess and queen, (Though Neptune has the mastery of the sea, Yet empress high above him still is she),\nYou know, Lord, that just as her desire\nIs to be quickened, lighted from your fire,And thus she follows you diligently,\nSo does the sea desire, naturally,\nTo follow her, since she is the goddess\nOf both the sea and rivers, great and less. Wherefore, Lord Phoebus, this is my request – Perform this miracle, or my heart may burst – That even now at your next opposition,\nWhen you are in the sign of the Lion,\nBeg that she so great a flood will bring\nThat five fathom at the least it may spring Higher than the highest rock in Brittany,\nAnd for two years let this great flood be. Then, surely, to my lady I may say,\n“Hold to your pledge; the rocks are all away.”\n‘Lord Phoebus, do this miracle for me:\nAsk her to run her course no more swiftly\nThan you, I say, request that your sister go\nNo faster than you, these two years though. Then she will be at full the entire way,\nAnd the spring flood last both night and day. And if she’ll not vouchsafe in that manner,\nTo grant to me my sovereign lady dear,\nBeg her to sink each rock deeper down\nInto her own dark region underground\nThe shadowy kingdom Pluto dwells in,\nOr nevermore shall I my lady win.\nYour temple at Delphi I’ll barefoot seek,\nLord Phoebus, see the tears run down my cheek, And on my pain have some compassion!’\nAnd with that he swooned after a fashion,\nAnd lay on the ground a long time in a trance.\nHis brother, who knew of this mischance, Caught him up, and to bed had him brought. Despairing, filled with his tormented thought, I’ll leave this sorrowing creature there to lie; Let him choose whether he’ll live or die!\nArvegarus, in health, with great honour,Like one who was of chivalry the flower,\nIs home again, with other noblemen.\nO joyous are you now, sweet Dorigen,\nWho have your gallant husband in your arms, The fresh knight, the worthy man at arms, Who loves you as he loves his own heart’s life! Nothing made him suspect that to his wife\nAny man had spoken, while he voyaged about, Of love indeed, nor was he plagued with doubt. He gave not a thought to any such matter,\nBut danced, jousted, and made much of her. And so in joy and bliss I’ll let him dwell, And of the ill Aurelius I will tell.\nLanguishing, and in torment furious, Two years and more lay sad Aurelius, Before the ground he dare set foot upon. Of comfort all this time he had none, Save from his brother, who was a clerk. He knew of all this woe and all this work; For to no other creature, it is certain, Dare he a single word of this explain,\nIn his breast bore it discretely rather,\nMore so than Pamphilus for Galatea.\nHis breast was whole, as outwardly was seen, But in his heart was ever the arrow keen;\nAnd a wound unhealed, with surface scar,\nIn surgery is perilous of cure\nUnless they touch the arrow, or come thereby.\nHis brother wept, away from public eye, Till finally he fell into remembrance\nThat while he was at Orleans in France – As students who are young and zealous To read in arts abstruse and curious\nSeek every nook and cranny, in turn, The recondite sciences for to learn – He recalled that once, upon a day, In the college, at Orleans, as I say,A book of natural magic, he saw\nBecause his friend a bachelor of law,\nThough he was there for other study,\nLeft it lying, on his desk, discretely.\nWhich book spoke fully of the operations Touching the eight and twenty mansions Belonging to the moon, and suchlike folly, Considered, in our day, not worth a flea;\nFor Holy Church’s faith, to our belief\nAllows no like illusion to bring grief.\nAnd when this book entered his remembrance, Swiftly his heart for joy began to dance,\nAnd to himself he said thus, privately:\n‘My brother will be cured right swiftly; For I am certain there are true sciences By which men conjure up appearances, Such as the subtlest conjurors display. For often at feasts, have I heard men say, Conjurors within a hall, full large,\nHave filled a space with water and a barge, And in the hall have rowed up and down. Sometimes a grim lion have they shown,\nAnd sometimes flowers sprang up instead, Sometimes a vine with grapes white and red, Sometimes a castle, all of lime and stone, And when they chose, they banished it, anon; Or so it seemed, to everyone in sight.\n‘Now then, I deduce, that if I might\nAt Orleans some old learned fellow find\nWho has the lunar mansions in his mind\nOr other natural magic, as above,\nHe could ensure my brother had his love.\nFor by illusions a learned man, in fact,\nCould make men think that all the rocks black Of Brittany had vanished every one,\nAnd ships along the shore might go and come, And then maintain the sight a week or so,So may my brother be cured of his woe; Then she must keep to all her promises, Or bring shame on herself, I’d suggest.’ Why must I make a longer tale of this? To his brother’s bed he came, and all his Comfort brought, urging him to be gone To Orleans, that he started up anon, And forward on the road did he fare, Hoping to be eased of all his care.\nWhen they had almost come to that city,\nOnly two furlongs short, or maybe three,\nA young clerk, roaming by himself, they met, Who greeted them in Latin, at the outset,\nWith great politeness, and this wondrous thing: ‘I know,’ quoth he,’ the reason for your coming And before a foot more they onward went,\nHe told them all about their true intent.\nOur Breton scholar asks him then to say What has become of scholars of past days, Whom he once knew: dead as it appears, At which he weeps a plethora of tears.\nDown from his horse Aurelius got, anon, And with the magician forth was gone\nHome to his house: he set them at their ease. They lacked no refreshment that could please; So well provisioned a house as was this one Aurelius in all his life had seen none.\nConjured for him, ere they went to supper, Were forests, parks, filled with wild deer; Where he saw stags with antlers high,\nThe largest ever seen by human eye.\nHe saw a hundred of them slain by hounds, Some, shot by arrows, bled from bitter wounds. And when they had all vanished, these wild deer, Came falconers beside a river fair,\nWho with their hawks had many heron slain. Then he saw knights jousting on a plain;And after this in conjured elegance,\nHe saw his lady there as she did dance,\nAnd he himself was dancing, as he thought. And when the master who this magic wrought Saw it was time, he clapped his hands, and lo, Farewell all our revel, it vanished so!\nAnd yet they had not moved from the house, While viewing all this sight so marvellous,\nBut in his study, with his books, the three\nOf them sat still, and no one else to see.\nHis squire then was summoned by the master, Who said to him: ‘Is all prepared for supper? Almost an hour it is, and no mistake,\nSince I bade you our supper swiftly make, While these worthy men I took with me\nInto the study, to view my library.’\n‘Sire’ quoth the squire, ‘I’ll make a vow That it is ready, you may eat right now.’ ‘Let us go sup, then, ‘quoth he, ‘that is best. Amorous people too must sometimes rest!’\nAfter the supper they bargained freely\nAs to what sum the master’s prize should be For removing all the rocks from Brittany, From Gironde too, to the Seine’s estuary.\nHe showed reluctance, swore, for God’s sake, Less than a thousand pounds he would not take, Certainly, for that sum he would have none.\nAurelius with blissful heart anon\nAnswered thus: ‘Fie on your thousand pound! This wide world of ours, men say is round,\nI would give that, if I were lord of it!\nThe bargain’s made, take what you think fit; You shall be paid, truly, on my oath.\nBut look you now, no negligence or sloth Must keep us here longer than tomorrow.’ ‘Nay,’ quoth the scholar, ‘on my faith, I vow.’\nAurelius went to bed, as he thought best,And well nigh all that night he took his rest. Tired with his labour, yet with hopes of bliss, Ease to his woeful heart came not amiss.\nOn the morrow, as soon as it was day, To Brittany they rode the nearest way, Aurelius, with the scholar at his side,\nAnd descended, where they would abide. It was, then, say the books, as I remember, The cold and frosty season, in December.\nPhoebus waxed old, and in this station\nDull brass was he, who in high declination Shines like burnished gold with rays so bright; But now in Capricorn he shed his light, Where full pale he shone, I dare maintain. The bitter frosts, with winter’s sleet and rain, All the garden greenery had interred.\nJanus sat by the fire with double beard,\nAnd from his bugle-horn he supped his wine, Before him brawn of the sharp-tusked swine, And ‘Sing, Noel!’ cried every lusty man.\nAurelius, doing all that ever a man can Gave the master good cheer and reverence, And prayed him to employ his diligence To release him from his pain’s fierce smart, Or plunge a sword into his very heart.\nThe subtle clerk took pity on the man And night and day as swiftly as one can Sought out a time to achieve conclusion, That is to say create the right illusion\nBy deft appearance, conjuror’s mystery –\nI lack the terms for such astrology –\nThat she and everyone would think and say That from Brittany the rocks were all away, Or else had been sunken underground.\nSo, at last, the proper date was found\nTo try his tricks and work the wretchedness Of all such superstitious cursedness.His Toledan tables forth he brought,\nRightly corrected, so he lacked for naught, Neither for blocks nor individual years,\nNor to fix the root, lacked nothing here\nFor his equations of centre, argument,\nAnd the proportionals convenient\nFor the calculation of everything:\nSo, from the stars’ eighth sphere, in his working, How far the moon’s first mansion had moved From the first point of Aries above,\nThat in the ninth sphere considered is;\nFull subtly he calculated this.\nWhen he had located the first mansion,\nHe knew all the rest by due proportion,\nAnd in which sign the moon rose he knew well And in which face and term, and so could tell Which was now the moon’s precise mansion, As a result of all this operation:\nAnd he knew the right observances,\nTo create such illusions and mischances\nAs heathen folk employed in olden days.\nAfter which there were no more delays,\nAnd through his magic, for two weeks I’d say, It seemed that all the rocks were cleared away.\nAurelius, still in despair through all of this, As to whether he’d have his love or fare amiss, Waited night and day to see this miracle.\nAnd when he knew there was no obstacle – And that the rocks had vanished every one – Down at the master’s feet he fell anon,\nAnd said: ‘I, woeful wretch, Aurelius,\nThank you, lord, and my lady Venus,\nWho have freed me from my cares cold!’\nAnd to the temple then away did go,\nTo where he knew he should his lady see.\nAnd when he saw his opportunity,\nWith fearful heart, full humbly did appear,And greeted then his sovereign lady dear. ‘My true lady,’ quoth this woeful man,\n‘Whom I most dread and love, deep as I can, Whom I would in this world least displease, Had I not suffered for you such miseries That I must die here at your feet anon,\nI’d not have shown that I was woebegone.\nBut surely I must die, or still complain;\nYou slay me, guiltless, merely from the pain. But though to sorrow for my death you’re loath, Think a while before you break your oath. Repent you so, and think of God above,\nBefore you punish me who seek your love. For, Madame, now recall the pledge I cite – Though I may claim nothing of you by right My sovereign lady, but only ask your grace – Yet in the garden, yonder, in that place,\nYou well know what you have sworn to me, And there your troth you plighted loyally\nTo love me best – God’s witness, you said so, Albeit that I am unworthy though.\nMadame, your honour I speak for, I vow, More than to save my heart’s life right now: I have done all that you commanded me, And if you deign to, you may go and see. Do as you will; yet have your oath in mind, For quick or dead, there you shall me find. With you it lies, to save my life or slay;\nBut true it is the rocks are now away.’\nHe took his leave, and she astonished stood. In her whole face was not a drop of blood. She had thought never to fall into this trap. ‘Alas!’ quoth she, ‘to suffer this mishap!\nI thought it an impossibility\nThat such a monstrous miracle could be! It defies the processes of nature.’\nAnd home she went, a sorrowful creature;For fear, indeed, she could scarcely move. She wept, she wailed there, for a day or two, And swooned so, that it was sad to see.\nBut why she did so, not a soul told she,\nFor far from town was her Arveragus.\nYet to herself she spoke, lamenting thus, With pallid face, and sorrowful did appear In her lament, as you may truly hear.\n‘Alas, Fortune, of you I will complain,\nWho suddenly have snared me in your chain, To escape from which I find no succour, Save only death, or else yet dishonour;\nOne of these two I must clearly choose.\nYet, nonetheless, I had much rather lose\nMy life, than see my body suffer shame,\nOr know myself as false, and lose my name. And by my death I may be quit of this.\nHas not many a noble wife, and foolish Maiden, slain herself before now, alas, Rather than bring her body to that pass?\nYes, for certain; lo, these tales bear witness. When thirty tyrants full of wickedness\nHad Phidon slain, in Athens at a feast,\nThey ordered his daughters to be seized\nAnd brought before them, humbled in their sight, All naked, to assuage their foul delight,\nAnd in their father’s blood they made them dance Upon the pavement – God send them mischance! For which these woeful maidens, full of dread, Rather than they should lose their maidenheads, Broke away, and leapt into a well,\nAnd drowned themselves, as the old books tell. The Messenians requested that men seek\nIn Lacadaemon, fifty maidens meek,\nOn whom they might work their lechery. But there was none of all that company That did not slay herself, with good intent,Choosing to die rather than to assent\nAnd be robbed there of their maidenhead. Why then of death should I remain in dread? Lo, then, the tyrant, Aristoclides,\nWho loved a maiden called Stimphalides, Who when her father slain was in the night, Unto Diana’s temple fled outright,\nAnd grasped hold of her statue too,\nFrom which statue she could not be loosed. No one there could tear her hands away,\nTill in that selfsame place, they did her slay.\nSince these maidens died before they might Be defiled by man’s foul appetite,\nA wife should rather kill herself than be Defiled by any man, it seems to me.\nWhat shall I say of Hasdrubal’s fair wife\nWho at Carthage deprived herself of life?\nFor when she knew the Romans had the town, She took her children all, and so leapt down Into the fire, and chose to perish there\nRather than any Roman ravage her.\nDid not Lucrece slay herself, alas,\nAt Rome when she oppressed was\nBy Tarquin, because she thought it shame\nTo be alive when she had lost her name?\nOf Miletus, the seven maids also\nSlew themselves indeed, for dread and woe, Rather than let the Gauls them oppress.\nMore than a thousand stories, I should guess, Might I now tell about the matter here.\nWhen Abradatas fell, his wife so dear\nSlew herself, and let her life-blood glide\nInto Abradatas’ wounds both deep and wide, And said: “My body, at the least, I say,\nNo man shall defile, for I go my way.”\nWhat need of more examples, to explain How so many women themselves have slainRather than be defiled, in misery?\nI conclude that better it is for me\nTo slay myself than be defiled thus.\nI will be true to my Arveragus,\nOr I will slay myself in some way here, As did Demotion’s daughter dear, Because she would not defiled be.\nO Scedasus, the heart fills with pity Reading how your daughter died, alas, Who slew herself in a similar pass.\nAs great a pity was felt, or even more, For the Theban maid who foiled Nicanor And slew herself, a case of equal woe. Another Theban maiden died also, Because a Macedonian her oppressed; Her death repaid her loss of maidenhead. What shall I say of Niceratus’ wife,\nWho in like case bereft herself of life? How true also to Alcibiades,\nHis lover was, who chose to die, as these, Rather than let his body unburied be?\nLo what a wife Alcestis was!’ quoth she. ‘What says Homer of good Penelope?\nAll Greece knew her wifely chastity.\nOf Laodamia is it written thus,\nThat when at Troy died Protesilaus,\nShe would no longer live beyond his day. The same of noble Portia, I may say: Without Brutus, she too could not live, For his was all the heart she had to give. The perfect wife was Artemisia, Honoured in Barbary by every peer.\nO, Teuta, queen, your wifely chastity\nTo every wife may as a mirror be!\nThe same thing I may say of Bilia,\nOf Rhodogue, and of Valeria.’\nSo Dorigen, a day or two, did sigh,Ever purposing that she would die.\nBut nonetheless, on the third night, Home came Avergarus, the noble knight, And asked her why she wept so sore;\nAt which she began to weep even more.\n‘Alas,’ quoth she, ‘that ever I was born!\nThus have I said,’ quoth she, ‘thus have I sworn’ – And told him all that you have heard before;\nNo need to repeat it here for you once more.\nHer husband, with kind face, in friendly wise, Answered, and said as I shall now advise:\n‘Is there aught else, Dorigen, but this?’\n‘Nay, nay,’ quoth she, ‘God help me, as it is,\nIt is too much, were it God’s own will!’\n‘Yet, wife,’ quoth he, ‘let sleep on what is still.\nAll may be well, perchance, even today.\nYou must keep your promise, by my faith! For, and may God have mercy upon me,\nI would rather be slain, mercilessly,\nFor the very love I have for you, I say,\nThan that your word you not keep always.\nHis word is the noblest thing a man may keep.’ – Yet with these words he began to weep,\nAnd said, ‘I forbid you, on pain of death, Ever, while left to you are life and breath,\nTo tell a single soul of this adventure.\nAs I best may, this woe I will endure;\nAnd show you no countenance of heaviness, Lest folk may think harm of you, or guess.’\nHe summoned forth a squire and a maid;\n‘Go forth anon, with Dorigen’ he said,\n‘And bring her to the place she tells, anon.’\nThey took their leave and on their way were gone, But they knew not why she thither went;\nHe told no one at all of his intent. Perchance a heap of you, a crowd that is,\nConsider him a foolish man in this, Seeking to place his wife in jeopardy.Hear the tale, then you may judge her truly;\nShe may have better fortune than it seems; Judge when you know whether the tale redeems.\nThat squire, you will remember, Aurelius,\nHe, who to Dorigen had proved so amorous, Happened by chance our Dorigen to meet,\nIn the town, and right in the busiest street,\nAs she was about to take the road, outright,\nTo the garden where her troth she did plight. And he was walking garden-ward also,\nFor he spied on her wherever she may go\nFrom her house to any manner of place.\nSo thus they met, by chance or yet by grace,\nAnd he saluted her with glad intent,\nAnd asked her then whitherward she went.\nAnd she answered, as though she were half-mad, ‘Unto the garden as my husband bade,\nTo keep my word to you, alas, alas!’\nAurelius, stunned at what had come to pass, Felt, in his heart, a true compassion\nFor her, and the cause of her lamentation, And for Arveragus, the worthy knight,\nWho bade her keep her word, come what might, So loath was he to let her stray from the truth. And in his heart such pity filled the youth,\nHe thought, considering it from every side,\nThat he should rather let intention slide, Than commit such churlish wretchedness Against generosity and gentleness.\nSo, briefly, in a few words, he said thus:\n‘Madame, say to your lord Arveragus,\nThat since I perceived his great nobleness,\nHis treatment of you, in your great distress, That he would rather be ashamed – sad truth – Than let you break your word to me, forsooth, Then I would rather suffer lasting woe\nThan ever harm the love between you so.I release, you, Madame, from your bond, Quit of every promise, out of hand,\nThat you have made to me heretofore,\nAs free as on the day when you were born. My troth I plight, that I shall never grieve You for promise given; and take my leave Of you, the best and the truest wife\nThat ever I have known in all my life.\nNow wives beware of oaths and, for the rest, Remember Dorigen, let me suggest!\nThus may a squire do a gentle deed\nAs well as any knight, as you can see.’\nShe thanked him then, on her knees all bare, And home to her husband she did fare,\nAnd told him everything you’ve heard said. You may be sure, he more joy displayed Than it were possible for me to write.\nWhat more of this story should I cite? Arveragus and Dorigen his wife\nIn sovereign bliss lived out their life.\nWith never any anger there between;\nHe cherished her as if she were a queen, And she was true to him for evermore.\nOf these two folk, now, you’ll hear no more.\nAurelius, who all the cost had borne, Cursed the day that ever he was born. ‘Alas,’ quoth he, ‘the promise that I made Of purest gold a thousand pound in weight To this philosopher! What shall I do?\nI see I must be ruined by loving, too!\nMy inheritance I needs must sell,\nAnd be a beggar – here I may not dwell, To shame all my kindred in this place – And yet he may reveal a better grace.\nFor nonetheless, perhaps, I might assay On certain days, year by year, to pay,\nAnd thank him then for his great courtesy.My word I will keep; no lies for me.’ With sore heart he went to his coffer,\nAnd took his gold to the philosopher,\nIn value, some five hundred pounds I guess, And beseeched him, of his gentleness,\nTo grant him time to pay the remainder; And said: ‘Master, this boast I make here, I’ve never failed of my word as yet.\nBe sure, I will be quit of all the debt Towards you, however I may fare,\nThough it mean I must beg, and go bare.\nIf you would vouchsafe, on security,\nTo give me respite for two years or three, All would be well, for else I must sell\nMy heritage; there is no more to tell.’\nThe philosopher soberly him answered, And said thus, when he the words had heard: ‘Did I not keep covenant with thee?’\n‘Yes, and well and truly, too,’ quoth he.\n‘Did you not win your lady, tell no lie?’\n‘No, no,’ quoth he, and sorrowfully did sigh. ‘What was the reason? Tell me if you can.’\nAurelius his tale anon began,\nAnd told him all that you have heard before; No need for me to tell it you once more.\nHe said: ‘Arveragus, in his nobleness, Would rather die in sorrow and distress, Than let his wife to her word be false.’ Dorigen’s sorrow also he told him of,\nHow loath she was to prove a wicked wife, Would rather that day have lost her life, And that she gave her word in all innocence; She’d never heard of magical disappearance. ‘It made me feel for her such deep pity, That as freely as he sent her to me,\nAs freely I sent her to him again.\nThat’s the long and short; the sense is plain.’The philosopher replied: ‘My dear brother, Each of you dealt nobly with the other. You are a squire, and he is a knight;\nBut God forbid, in His blissful might,\nThat a clerk may not do a noble deed\nAs well as either of you may, indeed!\nSire, I release you from your thousand pounds, As if you had but now crept out of the ground, And never, before now, had known of me.\nFor sire, I will not take a penny from thee\nFor all my skill, no, naught for my travail.\nYou have paid well for my bread and ale;\nThat is enough, and so farewell, good day!’ And then to horse, and forth he took his way.\nLordings, this question will I ask you now: Who was the most generous, sayest thou? Now tell me that, ere you farther wend!\nI can no more; my tale is at an end.",
	"Canterbury Tales: \n\t Nun's Priest's Tale ": "A poor widow, somewhat bent with age, Lived, long ago, in a little cottage, Beside a grove, standing in a dale.\nThe widow of whom I tell this tale, Since the day when she was last a wife,\nLed, patiently, a very simple life,\nFor little was her property or rent.\nBy husbandry, such as God her sent,\nShe kept herself, and two daughters poor. Three large sows had she, of swine no more, Three cows, and a sheep, as well, called Molly.\nFull sooty was her bower, all melancholy, In which she ate full many a scanty meal. No pungent sauce was needed for her veal; No dainty morsel ever passed her throat. Her diet, her cottage struck a single note. Repletion thus had never made her sick; And a moderate diet was all her physic, And exercise, and the heart’s abundance. The gout no reason gave her not to dance, No apoplexy smote her in the head.\nNo wine drank she, neither white nor red.\nHer board was mostly of the white and black – Milk and brown bread, of which she had no lack, Grilled bacon, and an egg or two, I say,\nFor she was, as it were, a dairy maid.A yard she had, enclosed all about\nWith palings, and a dry ditch without,\nIn which there roamed a cock called Chanticleer. In all the land, at crowing he’d no peer;\nHis voice was merrier than the merry organ\nOn Mass days in the chapel there, piping on. Truer was his crowing in the lodge\nThan is a clock or abbey horologe.\nBy nature he knew the right ascension\nOf the celestial equator, I’ll mention:\nFor each fifteen degrees of its ascending,\nHe would crow, as needed no amending.\nHis comb redder than the finest coral,\nWas crenellated like the castle wall.\nHis bill was black, and as the jet it shone;\nLike azure were his legs and toes, as one;\nHis claws were whiter than the lily flower,\nAnd like the burnished gold all his colour.\nThis noble cock had in his governance\nSeven hens, his pleasure to advance,\nWho were his sisters and his paramours,\nAnd wonderfully like him, as to colours;\nOf which the fairest, tinted round her throat, Was called the lovely lady Pertelote.\nCourteous she was, discreet and debonair, Companionable, and bore herself so fair\nFrom the day that she was seven nights old, That truly the heart she held in her hold\nOf Chanticleer, locked in her every limb.\nHe loved her so that all was well with him.\nAnd such a joy was it to hear them sing\nWhen that the bright sun began to spring,\nIn sweet accord, ‘My love’s in foreign land’.\n– For at that time, I’m given to understand, Beasts and birds as well could speak and sing.\nAnd it so befell, that in the early dawning, As Chanticleer among his wives allSat on his perch, lodged within the hall, And next to him sat the fair Pertelote, Chanticleer began moaning in his throat, Like a man who in a dream is troubled sore. And when Pertelote thus heard him roar, She was aghast, and said, ‘My heart, dear, What ails you, to moan as you do here?\nFie, what a sleeper! What a noise, for shame!’ And he answered her, saying thus: ‘Dear dame,\nI pray you not to take my noise amiss.\nBy God, I thought I was in such mischief\nJust now, my heart is pounding yet with fright! Now God’, quoth he, ‘read my dream aright, And keep my body from foul prison now!\nI dreamed that I wandered up and down Within our yard, and saw a kind of beast Shaped like a hound, that would have seized My body, and I seemed as good as dead.\nHis colour was betwixt yellow and red,\nAnd tipped was his tail, and both his ears, With black, unlike the rest of all his hairs.\nHis snout was small, and he was fiery eyed.\n– Of his mere looks alone I almost died!\nAnd this caused all my moaning, doubtless.’\n‘For shame!’ quoth she, ‘fie on timorousness! Alas!’ quoth she, ‘for, by the Lord above, Now have you lost my heart and all my love!\nI cannot love a coward, by my faith!\nFor certainly, whatever women say,\nThey all desire, if it might truly be,\nA husband who is brave, and wise and free, Discreet as well, no miser, and no fool,\nNor one aghast at every warlike tool,\nNor yet a boaster, by our Lord above!\nHow dare you say for shame, to your love,\nThat anything at all makes you a-feared?\nWhere is your man’s heart to match your beard?Alas, and are you aghast at dreaming?\nGod knows, dreams are vanity or nothing. Dreams are engendered by indigestion,\nAnd bodily exhalations and their action,\nAnd excessive humours dreams excite.\nFor sure, this dream that you met with tonight Comes from the greater superfluity\nOf your red choler, as it seems to me,\nWhich causes folks to be in dread, in dreams. Of arrows, and the fire’s reddening gleams, Of red beasts also, lest they seek to bite,\nOf warfare, and whelps both fierce and slight – Just as the humour of melancholy\nCauses full many a man to cry in sleep\nFor fear of black bears, or bulls black,\nOr else black devils clinging to his back.\nOf other humours I could tell also,\nThat work a man in sleep many a woe,\nBut I’ll pass on as lightly as I can.\nLo, Cato was ever so wise a man,\nDid he not say: “Take no account of dreams”? Now sire,’ quoth she, ‘when we flee our beam, For God’s love, go take a laxative!\nOn peril of my soul, long days to live,\nThat’s the best counsel, and no deceit,\nTo purge both choler and melancholy;\nAnd lest you find an excuse to tarry,\nBecause the town has no apothecary,\nI myself the right herbs will show you\nThat bring both health to us and profit too. And in our own yard these herbs I’ll find, Which in their properties are of the kind\nTo purge below, and do the same above. Don’t neglect them now, for God’s own love! You are quite choleric in complexion;\nBeware lest the sun in his ascension\nFind you all replete with humours hot!And if he does, I’ll bet a groat it’s not Long before you’ve a fever, a tertian,\nOr an ague that may prove your bane.\nA day or two you’ll need digestives\nOf worms, before you take your laxatives, Of laurel, centaury, and fumitory,\nOr else hellebore that grows so freely,\nOf caper-spurge or the blackthorn berry, Or plantain, growing in our yard, so merry. Peck them as they grow, and take them in! Be merry, husband, by your father’s kin! Fear you no dream – What I can say more?’\n‘Madame’ quoth he, ‘graunt merci for your lore! But nonetheless, regarding Cato now,\nWho for his wisdom won such great renown, Though he bade us hold no dream in dread, By God! Men have in old books often read\nIn many a text of more authority\nThan ever Cato’s had, God prosper me, The very reverse of all Cato’s sense And have found in their experience That dreams to us are significations Both of the joys and the tribulations That folk suffer in this life at present. There is no need for any argument; The proof itself is shown by the deed.\nOne of the greatest authors that men read, Cicero, says thus: two friends once went On pilgrimage, with serious intent;\nAnd it so chanced, they came to a town Where they such a congregation found\nOf people, and so many folk in passage, That there was not so much as a cottage In which they might both lodge for a fee. So that they had, out of necessity\nFor that one night, to part company; And each of them went to a hostelry,And found a lodging as it might befall,\nSo one of them was lodged in a stall,\nFar off, in a yard, with oxen used to plough; The other man was lodged well, I vow,\nAs chance favoured him, or else Fortune, She that governs all of us in common.\nAnd it befell that, long ere it was day,\nThe latter dreamed, in bed there as he lay,\nThat his friend began for him to call,\nCrying: “Alas! Here in an ox’s stall,\nThis night, I shall be murdered where I lie!\nNow help me, dearest brother, or I die!\nCome to me, and in all haste,” he cried.\nThe man from his sleep in fear did rise;\nBut once he’d woken, and banished sleep,\nHe took a turn, and thought the thing would keep, And that his dream was merely fantasy.\nSo twice in his sleep thus dreamed he,\nAnd yet a third time came his friend again\nAs he thought, and said, “Now I am slain.\nBehold my blood-stained wounds deep and wide! Rise early and in the morning-tide\nAt the west gate of the town”, quoth he,\n“A cart full of dung there you shall see,\nIn which my corpse was hidden secretly.\nHave the carter then arrested boldly.\nMy gold caused my murder: truth I say.”\n– And every detail of his death he gave,\nWith a full piteous face, pale of hue.\nAnd trust me, next day the dream proved true; For on the morrow, soon as it was day,\nThe man to his friend’s inn made his way.\nAnd when he came to the ox’s stall,\nFor his friend he began to call.\nThe innkeeper answered him anon,\nSaying: “Sire, your friend is long gone.\nAs soon as daylight came, he went from town.”This the man’s suspicion did arouse, Remembering the dreams he encountered;\nAnd forth he went – he would wait no longer – To the west gate of the town, where he found\nA dung cart, off to fertilise the ground,\nThat was in all particulars that arise\nThe same he heard the murdered man advise. And he began to cry, courageously,\nOn vengeance, justice for the felony:\n“My friend indeed was murdered this same night, And in this cart he lies gaping upright!\nI call upon the officers”, quoth he,\n“Charged to protect and keep this city!\nMurder! Alas, here lies my friend, I’ll state!” What more of this tale should I relate?\nFolk ran to tip the load out on the ground,\nAnd in the middle of the dung they found\nThe dead man, his murder shown anew.\nO blissful God, who are so just and true, Lo, how always murder you betray! Murder will out, we say day after day. Murder is so foul and abominable\nTo God, who is so just and reasonable, That he will not allow it long concealed, Though hidden for a year, or two, or three. Murder will out: that is my conclusion. And right anon, the officers of that town Seized the carter, and they racked him so, And then the innkeeper they racked also, That they confessed their wickedness anon, And were hanged high by the neck bone.\nThus dreams may prove serious indeed. And certainly in the same book I read, Right in the next chapter after this\n– I tell no lie, and so may I find bliss – Of two men who wished to pass the sea, For certain reasons, into a far country,If the wind had not proved contrary,\nAnd made them tarry there in the city, That stood full merry on the haven side. But at last, towards the evening-tide,\nThe wind began to blow from the west. Jolly and glad they went to their rest,\nAnd vowed that in the dawn they’d set sail.\nBut hearken to my marvellous tale.\nOne of them, as deep in sleep he lay,\nHad a wondrous dream, towards day\nHe thought a man stood by his bed-side, And commanded that he should abide, Saying; “If you should sail, as you intend, You will be drowned; my tale is at an end.”\nHe woke, and told his friend straight away,\nAnd begged him the voyage to delay;\nAnd for that day, he begged him to abide.\nHis friend, indeed, who lay by his bed-side,\nBegan to laugh, and jeer at him full fast.\n“No dream,” quoth he, “may make my heart aghast. I’ll not delay my plans for anything!\nI give never a straw for all your dreaming,\nFor dreams are but vain things, and mere japes. Men dream every day of owls or apes\nAnd of many a fantasy withal.\nMen dream of things that never are at all.\nBut since I see you’re settled to abide,\nAnd thus wilfully forsake the tide,\nGod knows, I’m sorry; yet, enjoy your day!”\n– And thus he took his leave, and went his way. But ere that he had half the voyage sailed,\nI know not why, or what mischance assailed, By some chance the ship’s planks were rent, And ship and man beneath the water went,\nIn sight of other ships close alongside,\nThat had sailed with them on that same tide.\nAnd therefore, fair Pertelote, my dear,From these old examples, it does appear That no man should show himself careless Regarding dreams, for I say, doubtless, Many a dream proves serious indeed.\nLo, in the life of Saint Kenelm I read, Son of Kenulphus, once the noble king Of Mercia, how Kenelm dreamed a thing, Shortly ere he was murdered, on a day, His murder in a vision saw, I say.\nHis nurse, she expounded, so they tell, His dream, and bade him guard him well From treason; yet he, but seven years old, Took little notice of the dream he told, So innocent and holy was his heart.\nBy God, I’d give my shirt, for a start,\nIf you’d read of his legend, like to me!\nDame Pertelote, I tell you truly, Macrobius, who writes of a vision\nOf Scipio’s in Africa, his opinion,\nAs he affirms, is that dreams may be Warnings of things that later men may see. And furthermore, I pray you, look you well In the Old Testament, at Daniel,\nAnd whether he thought dreams mere fantasy. Read of Joseph too, and there you shall see That dreams are sometimes – though not all – Warnings of things that later do befall.\nLook, too, at Egypt’s King, at Pharaoh,\nAt his baker and his butler also,\nAs to the consequences of their dreams! Whoever meditates on ancient themes\nMay find of dreams many a wondrous thing.\nLo, Croesus, who was of Lydia king,\nDid he not dream he sat upon a tree, Which signified that hanged he should be? Lo, there is Andromache, Hector’s wife, The day that Hector would lose his life,She dreamed the very same night before How Hector should die and be no more If he went that day into the battle.\nShe warned him, but it was of no avail; He went off to fight nevertheless,\nAnd was slain by Achilles, no less.\nBut the tale is all too long to tell,\nAnd now it is nigh day; I may not dwell On all of this, so say in conclusion, That I shall have from this prevision Adversity; and I say furthermore\nBy your laxatives I set no store,\nFor they are poison, I know full well.\nI defy them; I love not their spell!\nNow let us speak of mirth, forget all this. Madame Pertelote, thus have I bliss,\nIn one thing God has sent me large grace, For when I see the beauty of your face, You are so scarlet-red about your eye,\nIt quenches my fears and makes them die. For certain it is: In principio,\nMulier est hominis confusio.\n– Madame, the meaning of the Latin is: “Woman is man’s joy and all his bliss.” – For when I feel a-nights your soft side,\n– Even though I may not take a ride, Because our perch so narrow is, alas! –\nI am so full of joy and of solace,\nThat I defy both vision now and dream.’\nAnd with that word, he flew down from the beam, Since it was day, and also his hens all,\nAnd with a ‘chuck’ began his hens to call,\nFor he had found seed lying in the yard.\nRegal he was, no longer filled with dread; He covered Pertelote some twenty times, Trod her as often, ere that it was prime. Like a grim lion he gazes all around,And on his toes he saunters up and down; He deigns not to set foot upon the ground. He ‘chucks’ again each time a seed is found, And to him then run his dear wives all. Thus regal, as a prince is in his hall,\nI’ll leave this Chanticleer in his pasture, And next will I tell of his adventure.\nWhen the month with which the world began, Namely March, in which God first made man, Was complete, and past again also\nWhen March was done, thirty days and two, Befell it, Chanticleer in all his pride,\nHis seven wives walking by his side,\nCast up his eyes towards the bright sun,\nThat into the sign of Taurus now had run Twenty degrees and one, and somewhat more, And knew by nature, and no other lore,\nThat it was prime, and crowed with blissful voice. ‘The sun,’ he said, ‘is climbed in heavenly course, Forty degrees and one, and more, it is.\nMadame Pertelote, my world’s bliss,\nHearken, these blissful brides, how they sing, And see the fresh flowers how they spring!\nFull is my heart with revel and with solace!’\nBut suddenly he fell in sorrowful case; For ever the latter end of joy is woe.\nGod knows that worldly joy is swift to go; And any rhetorician who fair can write He in a chronicle can safely that indite, As a sovereign thing to note, indeed. Now ever wise man, let him list to me; This story is as true, I’ll undertake,\nAs the book of Launcelot of the Lake, That women hold in such great reverence. Now will I turn again to my utterance.\nA black-tipped fox of sly iniquity, Who in the grove had lived years three,With premeditated scheming, at a stroke,\nThat same night through hedge and fences broke, Into the yard, where Chanticleer the fair\nWas wont and his wives too, to repair;\nAnd in a bed of green-stuff still he lay\nTill it was near the middle of the day,\nWaiting the time for Chanticleer to fall,\nAs are wont to do these homicides all\nThat lie in wait to slay innocent men.\nO false murderer, lurking in your den!\nO new Escariot, new Ganelon!\nFalse dissimulator, O Greek Sinon,\nWho brought Troy all utterly to sorrow!\nO Chanticleer, accursed be the morrow When you flew to the yard from the beam! You were warned indeed by your dream That this day would be perilous to thee.\n– But what God foreknows must surely be, In the opinion of certain clerics.\nAsk witness of one who a true cleric is,\nThat in the schools has been great altercation About this matter, and great disputation, Wrought by a hundred thousand, every man. But I cannot sift the flour from the bran,\nAs can the holy doctor Saint Augustine, Boethius, or Bishop Bradwardine,\nAs to whether God’s noble foreknowing Means that I must then do a certain thing – By ‘must’ I denote simple necessity –\nOr whether free choice may be granted me\nTo do that same thing, or to do it not,\nThough God foreknew it ere that I was wrought, Or if his knowing constrains me not at all, Except by necessity conditional.\nWell, I’ll have naught to do with the matter; My tale’s of a cockerel, as you may hear, Who took his wife’s counsel, but in sorrow,To walk in the yard upon the morrow\nAfter he’d had the dream of which I told. Woman’s counsel oft leaves us dead and cold; Woman’s counsel brought us first to woe, And made Adam out of Paradise to go, Where he had been merry and full of ease. But as I know not whom it might displease\nIf I the counsel of women dare to blame,\nLet us pass on, I speak as if in game.\nRead the authors, treating of such matter, And of women you may hear their chatter. These are the cockerel’s words and not mine; I wish no harm to any woman divine.\nFair in the dust, to bathe her doth lie, Pertelote, with all her sisters by,\nOut in the sun, and Chanticleer so free Sings merrier than a mermaid in the sea (For Physiologus says for a certainty\nThat they sing right well and merrily).\nAnd it so befell, that as he cast his eye,\nAmong the green-stuff, at a butterfly,\nHe suddenly saw the fox lying low,\nNo longer had a reason then to crow,\nBut he cried anon, ‘Cock, cock!’ and up did start, As a man does who is a-feared at heart;\nFor by nature a beast desires to flee\nFrom its enemy, if one it chance to see, Though it has never seen such with its eye.\nNow Chanticleer, when he chanced to spy The fox, he would have fled, but fox anon Said: ‘Noble sir, alas, will you be gone?\nAre you afraid of me who am your friend? Now, surely, I’d be worse than any fiend\nIf I should do you harm or villainy!\nI have not come to steal your privacy; But truly, the reason for my coming Is only to hear how well you sing.For truly, you have as merry a voice,\nAs the angels who in Heaven do rejoice.\nAnd then you have in music more feeling\nThan Boethius, or any who can sing.\nMy lord your father – God his soul now bless! – And also your mother, of her great kindness, Once visited my house, to my great ease.\nAnd you sir, certainly, I seek to please.\nFor if men speak of singing, I must say\n– As own the use of my two eyes I may – Save for you, I never heard man sing\nAs your father did of a sweet morning.\nSure it was heart-felt, everything he sang! And to be sure his voice full loudly rang, He would take great pains that both his eyes Were tight shut, so louder were his cries, While standing on tiptoes therewithal,\nAnd stretching out his neck long and small; And also he was of such discretion\nThat there was no one in any region\nWho in song or wisdom might him surpass. I have read, in Burnellus the Ass,\nAmong its verses, how there was a cock, Who, when a priest’s son gave him a knock On his leg when young, served him amiss, And made him lose his sovereign benefice. But certainly, there’s no comparison Between the wisdom and discretion\nOf your good father, and such subtlety! Now sing on, sire, for holy charity;\nLet’s hear: can you your father emulate?’\nThen Chanticleer his wings began to beat, As one who could not foul treason see,\nHe was ravished so by such flattery.\nAlas, you lords, many a false flatterer Lives at your court, and many a cozener, Who pleases you better, by my faith,Than he who truthfulness does display! Read Ecclesiastes on flattery;\nBeware, you lords, of all their treachery.\nChanticleer stood up high on his toes, Stretched out his neck, and kept his eyes closed, And began to crow out loud for nones.\nSir Russell the fox started up at once,\nAnd by the throat seized Chanticleer,\nAnd on his back toward the wood, I fear, Carried him off, and nobody pursued.\nO Destiny that may not be eschewed! Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beam! Alas, that his wife ignored his dream!\n– And on a Friday fell all this mischance.\nO Venus, sweet goddess of love’s chance, Since it was your servant, Chanticleer,\nAnd in your service he spent his life dear, More for delight than race to multiply, Why suffer him on your own day to die?\nO Geoffrey of Vinsauf, my master sovereign, Who, when your great King Richard was slain By a bolt, lamented his death so sore,\nWhy have I not your wisdom and your lore, To chide the day, a Friday, as did you?\n– For he was slain upon a Friday too. Then my lament I would show you plain, For Chanticleer’s fear, and for his pain.\nFor sure, such cries and such lamentation Were never made by ladies when Ilium\nWas won, and Pyrrhus with his drawn sword, Having grasped King Priam by the beard, Slew him, as Virgil’s Aeneid tells us,\nAs all those hens made in the close When of Chanticleer they caught sight. But above all Dame Pertelote outright Cried louder than did Hasdrubal’s wife, When her dear husband lost his life,And the Romans set fire to Carthage;\nShe was so filled with torment and rage\nThat willingly into the flames she leapt, Steadfast of heart, her tryst with death she kept.\nO woeful hens, you cried as loudly\nAs, when Nero set fire to the city\nOf Rome, cried all the senator’s wives, Because their husbands had lost their lives; In their innocence Nero had them slain. Now will I turn to my tale again.\nThe poor widow, her daughters also,\nHeard the hens cry and all their woe,\nAnd out of the house they ran anon,\nAnd saw the fox towards the grove had gone, And on his back carried the cock away,\nAnd shouted out: ‘Thief!’ and ‘Well-away! It is the fox!’ – And after him they ran, And with staves many another man.\nRan Coll our dog, and Talbot and Gerland, And Malkin with a distaff in her hand;\nRan cow and calf, and the very hogs,\nFrightened by the barking of the dogs,\nAnd the shouting of men and women, worst,\nThey ran so I thought their hearts would burst. They yelled as the fiends do down in Hell;\nThe ducks quacked as though death loomed as well; The geese for fear flew high above the trees;\nOut of the hive came a swarm of bees.\nSo hideous was the noise – ah, benedictitee! –\nI’m sure Jack Straw and all his company\nNever uttered shouts one half so shrill,\nWhen they wished the Flemings all to kill,\nAs this day rose up behind the fox.\nTrumpets of brass they brought, flutes of box,\nOf horn, of bone, to blow out loud and hoot,\nAnd therewithal they shrieked and whooped;\nIt seemed as if the heavens themselves would fall!Now, good men, I pray you, hearken all: Lo, how Fortune alters suddenly\nThe hope and pride of their enemy!\nThe cock that lay upon the fox’s back, Despite his fear, spoke to the fox: ‘Alack, Sire, if I were you, as it seems to me,\nI’d turn my head, and shout, God help me, “Turn back again, you proud peasants all! And a foul pestilence upon you fall!\nNow I have reached the woodland-side, Despite your chase, the cock shall here abide. I’ll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!”’\nThe fox said, ‘By my faith, it shall be done!’ – And as he spoke the words, all suddenly, The cock broke from his mouth full swiftly, And high into a tree he flew anon.\nAnd when the fox saw that the cock was gone, ‘Alas!’ quoth he, ‘O Chanticleer, alas!\nI have done you,’ quoth he, ‘a foul trespass, Inasmuch as I rendered you a-feared,\nWhen I seized you and then brought you here. But sire, I did it with no harsh intent;\nCome down, and I’ll explain what I meant. God help me, I’ll tell you all the truth!’\n‘Nay, then’ quoth he, ‘and curses on us two! And first I’ll curse myself, both blood and bones, If you deceive me oftener than once!\nYou shall no more, with your foul flattery,\nMake me sing, close my eyes so foolishly;\nFor he that shuts his eyes when he should see, Willingly, let him not thrive, for me!’\n‘Nay,’ quoth the fox, ‘may God give him mischance Who is so careless of his governance,\nAnd chatters when he should hold his peace!’\nLo, such it is to be reckless indeed,\nAnd negligent, and trust in flattery!\nBut you that think this tale but a folly,And all about a fox, and cock, and hen,\nTake note of the moral, my good men.\nFor Saint Paul says all that written is,\nFor our understanding’s written, as is this, Take the grain, and leave the chaff there still. Now, gracious God, if it should be thy will (As said my Lord), so make us all good men, And bring us to the heights of bliss! Amen.",
