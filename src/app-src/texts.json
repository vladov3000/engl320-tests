	"Canterbury Tales General Prologue": "When that April with his showers sweet\nThe drought of March has pierced root deep, And bathed each vein with liquor of such power That engendered from it is the flower,\nWhen Zephyrus too with his gentle strife,\nTo every field and wood, has brought new life In tender shoots, and the youthful sun\nHalf his course through the Ram has run, And little birds are making melody,\nWho all the night with open eye do sleep – Nature their hearts in every way so pricks – Then people long to go on pilgrimage,\nAnd palmers who seek out foreign strands, To far-off shrines, renowned in sundry lands; And specially, from every shire’s end\nOf England, down to Canterbury they wend, The holy blissful martyr there to seek,\nWho had aided them when they were sick.\nIt befell that in that season on a day, In Southwark at The Tabard as I lay, Ready to set out on my pilgrimage\nTo Canterbury with pious courage, There came at night to that hostelry Quite nine and twenty in a company Of sundry folk who had chanced to fall Into a fellowship, and pilgrims all,\nThat towards Canterbury meant to ride.\nThe chambers and the stables were full wide, And we housed at our ease, and of the best; And shortly, when the sun had gone to rest, I had such speech with each and everyone,That of their fellowship I soon made one, Agreeing I would make an early rise,\nTo take our way there, as I now advise.\nNonetheless while I have time and space, Before a step more of my tale I pace,\nIt seems to me in full accord with reason, To tell you everything of their condition, Of each of them, as they appeared to me, And who they were, and of what degree, And what apparel they were travelling in; And with a knight then I will first begin.\nThere was a KNIGHT and he a worthy man, That from the day on which he first began,\nTo ride abroad, had followed chivalry,\nTruth, honour, courtesy and charity.\nHe had fought nobly in his lord’s war,\nAnd ridden to the fray, and no man more, As much in Christendom as heathen place, And ever honoured for his worth and grace. When we took Alexandria was there;\nOften at table held the place of honour, Above all other nations too in Prussia; Campaigned in Lithuania and Russia,\nNo Christian man of his rank more often. At the siege of Algeciras had he been,\nIn Granada, and on Moroccan shore;\nHe was at Ayash and Antalya\nWhen taken, and many times had been\nIn action on the Mediterranean Sea.\nOf mortal battles he had seen fifteen,\nAnd fought for the faith at Tramissene Thrice in the lists and always slain his foe. This same worthy knight had been also With the Emir of Balat once, at work\nWith him against some other heathen Turk; Won him a reputation highly prized,\nAnd though he was valiant, he was wise,And in his manner modest as a maid.\nAnd never a discourtesy he said\nIn all his life to those who met his sight; He was a very perfect gentle knight.\nBut to tell of his equipment, his array,\nHis horses fine, he wore no colours gay Sported a tunic, padded fustian\nOn which his coat of mail left many a stain; For he was scarcely back from his voyage, And going now to make his pilgrimage.\nWith him there was his son, a young SQUIRE, Lover and lively bachelor entire\nWith locks as crisp as from a curling-press;\nOf twenty years of age he was, I guess.\nOf his stature, he was of middle height, Wonderfully agile, powerful in a fight. And had served a while in the cavalry, In Flanders, in Artois and Picardy,\nAnd done so well, and in so short a space, He hoped for favour from his lady’s grace. Like to a meadow he was embroidered, One full of fresh flowers white and red. Singing he was, or playing flute all day;\nHe was as fresh as is the month of May.\nShort was his gown, with sleeves both long and wide; He knew how to sit a horse, and could ride.\nHe could make songs, and compose aright,\nJoust and dance, and draw things well and write.\nHe loved so hotly night through without fail\nHe slept no more than does the nightingale. Courteous he was, humble, attentive, able,\nAnd carved for his father at the table.\nA YEOMAN had he (servants did forgo Other than this, and chose to travel so),\nOne who was clad in coat and hood of green. A sheaf of peacock arrows, bright and keen Sheathed in his belt he bore right properly –Well could he dress his gear, yeomanly;\nHis arrows never drooped with feathers low – And in his hand he bore a mighty bow. Cropped hair he had, and a nut-brown visage; Of woodcraft he well knew all the usage.\nOn his arm an archer’s brace he wore,\nAnd by his side a buckler and a sword,\nAnd at the other side a jaunty dagger Ornamented, and sharp as any spear;\nOn his breast St Christopher did gleam.\nHe bore a horn, the baldric was of green.\nHe truly was a forester, I guess.\nThere was also a nun, a PRIORESS,\nHer smile itself ingenuous and coy.\nHer greatest oath was only ‘by Saint Loy’, And she was called Madame Eglentine.\nFull well she sung the service, divine, Intoning through her nose, all seemly,\nAnd fair French she spoke, all elegantly, After the school of Stratford-atte-Bowe;\nFor French of Paris was not hers to know. At meals she had been taught well withal; And from her lips she let no morsel fall,\nNor dipped her fingers in the sauce too deep; Well could she take a morsel and then keep The slightest drop from falling on her breast; Courtesy it was that pleased her best.\nHer upper lip she would wipe so clean\nThat in her cup no trace of grease was seen When she had drunk her draught; and to eat, In a most seemly manner took her meat. And certainly she had a cheerful manner, Pleasant and amiable in her behaviour,\nTook pains to imitate the ways of court, Display a stately bearing as she ought,\nAnd be considered worthy of reverence.\nAs for consideration of her conscience,She was so charitable, tender, anxious,\nShe would weep if she but saw a mouse\nCaught in a trap, if it were dead or bled.\nOf slender hounds she had, that she fed\nWith roasted flesh, or milk, and fine white bread; But wept sorely when one of them was dead\nOr if men struck it with a stick too hard, And all was sentiment and tender heart. Her wimple was pleated in a seemly way, Her nose was elegant, her eyes blue-grey; Her lips quite fine, and also soft and red, But certainly she had a fair forehead,\nIt was almost a span broad, I deem,\nFor she was not small of build, I mean.\nHer cloak was very elegant, I saw;\nFine coral round her arm she wore\nA rosary, the larger beads were green,\nAnd from it hung a brooch of golden sheen, On which there first was writ a crowned A, And after: ‘Amor vincit omnia’.\nAnother NUN she had with her, and she Was her chaplain, and with them priests three. A MONK there was, of the highest degree, Who loved to hunt, agent of a monastery,\nA manly man, for an Abbot’s role quite able. Full many a fine horse had he in his stable, His bridle, when he rode, men might hear Jingling in a whistling wind as clear,\nAnd quite as loud as does the chapel bell. Now as this lord was prior of his cell,\nThe rule of Saint Benedict and Saint Mawr,\nAs old and somewhat strict he would ignore, This same monk scorned the old world’s pace, And spurred after the new world, apace.\nHe gave not for that text a plucked hen\nThat says that hunters are not holy men,\nAnd that a monk when he grows heedlessIs like a fish that’s all waterless –\nThat is to say a monk out of his cloister –\nBut he held that text not worth an oyster.\nAnd I agreed his views were scarcely bad:\nWhat! Should he study, drive himself quite mad, In his cloister over a book must pore,\nOr labour with his hands, and toil the more\nAs Augustine bids? How would the world run? Let Augustine keep his labour for his own!\nTherefore he was a hunting man outright. Greyhounds he had, as swift as birds in flight; Tracking with dogs and hunting the hare\nWas all his pleasure, no cost did he spare.\nI saw his sleeves were trimmed at the wrist With grey fur, and of the country’s finest; And to fasten his hood beneath his chin, He had a wrought-gold elaborate pin;\nA love-knot in the larger end there was.\nHis head was bald, and shone like any glass, And his face, as if he had been anointed; He was a lord full fat, and well appointed. His bulging eyeballs, rolling in his head, Glowing like a cauldron-fire well-fed; Supple his boots, his horse in perfect state. Now certainly he was a fair prelate;\nHe was not pale like some tormented ghost. A fat swan he loved best of any roast;\nHis palfrey was as brown as is a berry.\nA FRIAR there was, a wanton one and merry, A Limiter, a very jovial man.\nIn all the friars’ four orders none that can\nLead a discussion in fairer language.\nAnd he had arranged many a marriage Of young women, granting each a dower. He was a noble pillar of his Order. Well-beloved and intimate was he\nWith Franklins within his boundary,And also worthy women of the town;\nHad power to confess coat and gown –\nAs he said himself – more than a curate, Having licence from his bishop to do it. Full sweetly he would hear confessions, And very pleasant were his absolutions.\nHe was an easy man at granting penance From which he made more than a pittance. When to a poor Order alms are given\nIt is a token that a man’s well-shriven;\nSince he dared claim that from the intent,\nOf giving, then the man was penitent.\nFor many a man is so hard of heart\nHe cannot weep, though he feels the smart. Therefore instead of weeping and prayer, Better to give the poor friars silverware.\nHis sleeve’s end was stuffed with pocket-knives And gilded pins, to give to pretty wives.\nHe could hold a note for sure; could sing\nAnd play quite sweetly on the tuneful string. Such competitions he won easily.\nHis neck was white as the fleur-de-lis;\nAnd he was as strong as any champion.\nHe knew the taverns well in every town,\nAnd all the barmaids and innkeepers,\nRather than the lepers and the beggars\nSince such a worthy man as he\nIt suited not his calling or degree,\nWith such lepers to maintain acquaintance.\nIt is not seemly – helps no man advance –\nTo have dealings with such poor people,\nOnly with the rich, sellers of victuals.\nAn everywhere a profit might arise,\nHe wore a courteous and humble guise;\nThere was no man half so virtuous.\nHe was the finest beggar of his house\n– and paid a fixed fee for the right;None of his brethren poached in his sight. For though a widow lacked a shoe\nSo pleasant was his ‘In principio’,\nHe yet would gain a farthing as he went. His income was far greater than his rent, And he romped around, like any whelp. In settling disputes he could help,\nNot like a friar from a cloister,\nWith threadbare cloak, like needy scholar, But he was like a doctor or a pope;\nOf double worsted was his demi-cloak,\nA bell shaped from the mould, its fashion. He lisped a little out of affectation,\nTo sound his English sweet upon the tongue; And in his harping, whenever he had sung, His eyes would twinkle in his head aright\nAs do the stars on high in frosty night. Hubert his name, this worthy Limiter.\nA MERCHANT was there, with a forked beard, Dressed in motley, high on horse he sat.\nUpon his head a Flemish beaver hat,\nBuckled his boots were, fair and neatly.\nHe made his comments solemnly, fully, Boasting of profits ever increasing,\nWishing sea-trade secure, more than anything, Twixt Middleburgh and the River Orwell.\nHe could exchange monies, buy and sell. This worthy man made such use of his wits; No one knew he was beset by debts,\nSo stately his manner of behaving,\nIn his bargaining, and money-lending.\nTruly a worthy man then, all in all,\nBut truth to tell, I know not what he’s called.\nA CLERK there was of Oxford town also, Who had set himself to logic long ago. Thinner was his horse than many a rake, And he was none too fat, I’ll undertake,But gazed quite hollowly, and soberly.\nHis jacket threadbare, where the eye could see; For he had not yet found a benefice,\nFar too unworldly ever to seek office.\nHe would rather have at his bed-head\nTwenty books, clad in black or red,\nOf Aristotle and his philosophy,\nThan rich robes, fiddle, and sweet psaltery. But though he was a true philosopher\nNo stone for making gold lay in his coffer! But every single penny his friends lent,\nOn books and on learning it was spent,\nAnd for the souls he offered up a prayer,\nOf those who funded him to be a scholar.\nOf study he took most care, and most heed. He spoke not one word more than he need, And that was formal, said with reverence, Short, and quick, and in a noble sentence. Agreeing with moral virtue all his speech,\nAnd gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.\nA SERGEANT AT LAW, wise and cautious, Often consulted at St Paul’s porch and such, Was also there, rich in excellence.\nDiscreet he was, a man for reverence –\nOr so he seemed, his words being so wise. He had often been a Justice at assize,\nBy letters patent and by full commission. By his science and his high renown\nOf fees and robes he garnered many a one. So great a buyer of land was never known; All was his in fee-simple, in effect.\nHis purchases were not the least suspect. More business than he had, no man has, And yet he seemed busier than he was.\nHe had correctly cases, judgements, all From King William’s time in men’s recall. Moreover he could draw up anything,That no man might find fault with its drafting; And every statute he could cite by rote,\nHe rode along in a simple striped coat,\nTied with a silken belt, its clasps of metal;\nOf his array I will no further tell.\nA FRANKLIN was in his company;\nWhite was his beard as is the daisy.\nOf his complexion he was sanguine;\nHe loved a sop in wine each morning.\nTo live in delight was ever his wont,\nFor he was Epicurus’ very son,\nWho held the view that perfect delight\nWas the true felicity outright.\nA hospitable householder was he\nSaint Julian he was to his county.\nHis bread and ale always second to none;\nAnd no better wine than his was known.\nHis house was never short of fish and flesh, Of pastry dishes, and all so plenteous\nIt snowed in his house with meat and drink, And all the dainties of which men might think. In accordance with the seasons of the year,\nSo he changed his dinner and his supper.\nFull many a fat partridge had he in coop,\nAnd many a bream and pike in the pool.\nWoe to his cook unless his sauces were Pungent and tasty, and every dish prepared! His table fixed in his hall stood always\nReady set with covers, every day.\nAt court-sessions he was lord and sire;\nAnd oftentimes was Member for the Shire.\nA two-edged dagger and a purse of silk\nHung at his girdle, white as morning milk.\nA Sheriff had he been, and a lawyer;\nNowhere lived so worthy a landowner.\nA HABERDASHER, CARPENTER, a WEAVER A DYER too, and TAPESTRY-MAKER,Were there all clothed in the livery\nOf their imposing guild fraternity.\nFull fresh and new their costume was; Their knives were mounted not with brass But all with silver, wrought clean and well, Their girdles and their pouches as befell. Each of them seemed a splendid burgess Fit to grace a guildhall on a dais.\nEach owning as much wisdom as man can,\nWas suitable to be an alderman,\nFor they had property enough and rent,\nAnd wives too who would give their assent. They would be blamed for sure were it not done; It is a fine thing to be called ‘Madame’,\nAnd go to vigil before the celebration, With mantle royally carried, on occasion.\nA COOK they had with them I own\nTo boil the chickens with the marrow-bones, And pungent flavouring, spices without fail. Well could he distinguish London ale;\nHe could roast and seethe and boil and fry, Make thick soup and bake a tasty pie.\nBut a mortal pity, it seemed to me,\nThat on his shin an ulcerous sore had he. Yet a fricassee, he made it with the best.\nA SHIPMAN was there, from out the west; A Dartmouth man for all I understood.\nHe rode a hired hack, as best he could,\nIn a woollen gown that reached his knee,\nA dagger hanging on a cord had he,\nAbout his neck, under his arm, and down.\nThe summer heat had tanned his visage brown. And certainly he was a splendid fellow;\nFull many a draught of wine he made flow From Bordeaux, the merchant fast asleep,\nThe nicer rules of conscience did not keep:\nIf he fought, and gained the upper hand,He sent men home by water to every land. As for his skill in calculating tides,\nCurrents, and every other risk besides, Harbours and moons, on every voyage, There was none such from Hull to Carthage. Hardy he was, wise in his undertakings,\nIn many a tempest had his beard been shaken. He knew all the havens that there were\nFrom Gotland’s Isle to Cape Finisterre,\nAnd every creek in Brittany and Spain;\nThe barque he owned was called the Magdalene. With us there was a DOCTOR OF PHYSIC.\nIn all this world none ever saw his like On points of physic and of surgery,\nFor he was grounded in astronomy.\nHe knew the best hours for the sick,\nBy the power of his natural magic.\nAnd could select the right ascendant\nFor making talismans for his patient.\nHe knew the cause of every malady, Whether of hot or cold, or moist and dry, And where engendered, of what humour; He was a truly perfect practitioner.\nThe cause known, and of the ill its root,\nHe gave the sick man remedy to suit.\nTo send him medicines, his apothecaries\nAnd potions too, they were ever ready,\nFor each enhanced the other’s profiting – There needed no new friendship there to win. He was well-versed in Aesculapius,\nAnd Dioscorides and likewise Rufus, Old Hippocrates, Hali and Galen, Serapion, Rhazes and Avicen,\nAverroes, Damascenus, Constantinus, Bernard, and Gaddesden, and Gilbertus. In his diet quite moderate was he,\nFor it avoided superfluity,But nourishing it was, digestible.\nHe made little study of the Bible.\nIn red and blue, and colours of that ilk, Lined with taffeta, was clad, and silk. And yet he was most careful of expense; He kept the money won from pestilence. For gold in physic is a cordial;\nTherefore he loved gold above all.\nA good WIFE was there from next to BATH, But pity was that she was somewhat deaf.\nIn cloth-making she was excellent,\nSurpassing those of Ypres and of Ghent.\nIn all the parish there was no wife, so\nBefore her to the Offertory might go –\nAnd if they did, indeed, so angry she\nThat she was quite put out of charity.\nHer kerchiefs were finely wove I found;\nI dare to swear those weighed a good ten pounds, That on a Sunday she wore on her head.\nHere hose were of a fine scarlet red,\nAnd tightly tied: her shoes full soft and new. Bold was her face, and fair and red of hue. Had been a worthy woman all her life; Husbands at the church-door she had five, Besides other company in her youth –\nNo need to speak of that just now, in truth. And thrice had she been to Jerusalem;\nShe had crossed many a foreign stream.\nAt Boulogne she had been, and Rome,\nSt James of Compostella, and Cologne,\nAnd she knew much of wandering by the way, Gap toothed was she, truthfully to say.\nAt ease upon a saddle-horse she sat,\nWell wimpled, and on her head a hat\nAs wide as a small buckler or large shield,\nHer large hips an over-skirt concealed,\nAnd on her feet a pair of sharp spurs sat.In fellowship she loved to laugh and chat; And remedies for love she had, by chance, For in that art she knew the oldest dance.\nA holy man there was of good renown, Who was a poor PARSON to a town,\nBut rich he was in holy thought and works. He also was a learned man, a clerk,\nThat Christ’s gospel earnestly would preach; His parishioners devoutly he would teach. Benign he was and wondrous diligent,\nAnd in adversity extremely patient,\nAnd proven to be such as many times.\nHe was loth to curse men over tithes,\nBut preferred to give, without a doubt,\nTo the poor parishioners round about, From his own goods and the offerings,\nHe found sufficiency in little things.\nWide was his parish, and houses far asunder, But he neglected naught, in rain or thunder, In sickness or affliction went to all\nThe farthest in his parish, great or small,\nUpon his feet, and in his hand a stave.\nThis fine example to his flock he gave,\nThat first he wrought, and afterward he taught. Out of the gospel he those words had caught; And this maxim he would add thereto,\nThat if gold rust, what should iron do?\nFor if the priest be foul in whom we trust,\nNo wonder if the layman turn to rust!\nAnd shame it is, and let priests note, to see\nThe shepherd doused in shit, the sheep still clean. The true example the priest ought to give\nIs by his cleanness how the sheep should live.\nHe did not set his benefice to hire\nAnd leave his sheep encumbered in the mire, Running off to London to Saint Paul’s,\nTo work a wealthy chantry for dead souls,Or in guild brotherhood remain enrolled\nBut dwelt at home and cared well for his fold, So that no wolf should make his task miscarry. He was a shepherd not a mercenary.\nAnd though he was holy and virtuous,\nHe did not scorn the sinful, nor because\nOf it in speech was proud or over-fine,\nBut in his teaching was discreet, benign;\nTo draw folk towards heaven by gentleness, By good example – such was his business.\nBut if anyone proved obstinate,\nWhoever he was, of high or low estate,\nHe would rebuke him sharply, him to punish. A better priest I think there nowhere none is. He never looked for pomp or reverence,\nNor showed a too fastidious conscience,\nBut Christ’s lore, and his Apostles’ twelve,\nHe taught, but first he followed it himself.\nWith him there was a PLOUGHMAN, was his brother, Many a load of dung, one time or other,\nHe had carted, a good true worker he,\nLiving in peace and perfect charity.\nGod loved he best with all his whole heart At all times, whether with delight or smart, Then his neighbour loved he as himself.\nHe would thresh the corn, and dig and delve, For Christ’s sake, grant the poor their hour, Without reward, if it lay in his power.\nHis tithes he paid in full, fair and well, Both of his labour and his capital.\nIn a loose tunic he rode on a mare.\nThere was a REEVE also and a MILLER,\nA SUMMONER and a PARDONER as well, A college MANCIPLE, and then myself.\nThe MILLER was a strong man I own;\nA stout fellow, big in brawn and bone.\nIt served him well, for, everywhere, the man,At wrestling, always looked to win the ram. Broad, thick-set, short in the upper arm, Off its hinges, he lifted any door,\nOr ran at it and broke it with his head.\nHis beard, as any sow or fox, was red, And broad as well, as if it were a spade. On the tip of his nose he displayed\nA wart, and on it stood a tuft of hair, Red as the bristles in a sow’s ear.\nHis nostrils were as black as they were wide; A sword and buckler he wore at his side. His mouth as great was as a great furnace. He was a loudmouth and to his disgrace Told stories most of sin and harlotry.\nHe stole corn, and made one toll pay three; Yet had the golden thumb, a mystery!\nA white coat and a blue hood wore he;\nThe bagpipes he could blow well and sound, And that was how he piped us out of town.\nThe MANCIPLE was of the Inner Temple, All purchasers might follow his example\nOf wisdom in the buying of victuals;\nFor whether he paid cash or owed it all\nHe was so careful always in his purchase, That he was all prepared and acted first. Now is it not a wonder of God’s grace That a man so illiterate can outpace\nThe wisdom of a host of learned men?\nOf masters he had more than thrice ten, Expert in the law and meritorious,\nOf whom there were a dozen in that house Worthy to be stewards of rent and land For any lord who lives in England,\nAnd show him the income to be had Debt-free, from his estates, less he were mad, Or be as frugal as he should desire;\nAnd they were able to assist a shireIn any case that chanced to arise – And yet this Manciple outdid the wise.\nThe REEVE was a slender, choleric man. His beard was shaved as close as any can; His hair by his ears was fully shorn;\nThe top was cropped like a priest before. His legs were long, and very lean,\nLike sticks they were – no calves to be seen. He kept a tidy granary and bin;\nNo auditor could get the best of him.\nWell could he judge from drought or rain The yield of his seed and of his grain.\nHis lord’s sheep, beef-cattle, and his dairy, His swine, his horses, stock and poultry, Was wholly in this Reeve’s governance And he made reckoning by covenant, Since his lord had only twenty years;\nNo man could find him ever in arrears.\nNo bailiff, cowherd, servant of any kind\nBut their deceits and tricks were in his mind; They feared him like the plague, is my belief. He had a pleasant dwelling on a heath,\nWith green trees shadowed was the sward. He could purchase better than his lord;\nHe had riches of his own privately.\nHe could please his lord subtly,\nGiving and lending of his own goods,\nAnd earn his thank you and a coat and hood. In youth he had a good and learned master; He was a fine craftsman, a carpenter.\nThis Reeve sat on a farm-horse that was\nAll dappled grey and bore the name of Scot. A long bluish top-coat he displayed,\nAnd by his side he bore a rusty blade.\nOf Norfolk was this Reeve of whom I tell, Near a town that men call Bawdeswell.\nHis gown was tucked up like a friar’s about,And he always rode the hindmost on the route. A SUMMONER was with us in that place,\nWho had a fiery-red cherubim’s face, Carbuncled so, and his eyes were narrow.\nHe was hot and lecherous as a sparrow,\nWith scabby black brows and scrubby beard; Of his visage children were a-feared.\nNo quicksilver, lead salve, or brimstone, Borax, ceruse, or oil of tartar known,\nNo ointment that would cleanse and bite, Could cure him of his pimples white,\nOr of the lumps rising from his cheeks.\nWell loved he garlic, onions, and leeks,\nAnd to drink strong wine, as red as blood; Making him speak, and cry, as madman would. And when he had drunk, and the wine was in, Then he would speak no word but Latin.\nA few tags he had, some two or three,\nThat he had learned out of some decree –\nNo wonder, since he heard them every day. And you well know moreover how a jay\nCan say ‘Walter’ better than the Pope –\nBut try any other matter’s scope,\nThen had he spent all his philosophy;\nAy ‘Questio quid iuris’ was his plea.\nHe was a noble rogue and a kind;\nA better fellow no man could find.\nHe would allow, for a quart of wine,\nA good friend to keep a concubine\nA twelvemonth and excuse him fully;\nAnd he could pluck a fool privately.\nAnd if he made a good friend anywhere,\nHe would teach him not to have a care\nIn such a case of the Archdeacon’s curse, Unless a man’s soul lay in his purse,\nFor in his purse he should punished be.\n‘The purse is the Archdeacon’s hell,’ said he.But well I know he lied in what he said; For his curse each guilty man should dread, Since absolution saves, but slays that writ, And so ware of that word Significavit.\nHe had in his power as he pleased\nAll the young folk of the diocese,\nKnew their secrets, they by him were led. A garland had he set upon his head,\nBig as an inn-sign’s holly on a stake;\nA buckler he had made him of a cake.\nWith him there rode a noble PARDONER Of Charing Cross, his friend and his peer, Returned directly from the Court of Rome. He sang out loud: ‘Come hither, love, to me!’ The Summoner sang a powerful bass around; Never a trumpet of half so great a sound.\nThe Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax, But smooth it hung like a hank of flax. In clusters hung the locks he possessed, With which his shoulders he overspread; But thin they fell, in strands, one by one. But hood, to adorn them, he wore none, For it was trussed up in his wallet –\nHe thought he rode fashionably set; Dishevelled, save his cap, he rode all bare. Such bulging eyeballs had he as a hare.\nA pilgrim badge had he sewn on his cap;\nHis wallet lay before him in his lap,\nBrimful of pardons, come from Rome hotfoot. A voice he had as small as has a goat;\nNo beard had he, nor ever looked to have;\nAs smooth it were as it were lately shaved –\nI judge he was a gelding or a mare.\nBut of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware, Never was such another Pardoner.\nAnd in his bag a pillow-case was there,\nWhich he claimed was Our Lady’s veil;He said he had a fragment of the sail\nThat Saint Peter used, when he skimmed Upon the sea till Jesus summoned him.\nHe had a cross of brass set with stones, And in a glass, he had pigs’ bones.\nAnd with these relics, when he had to hand Some poor parson living on the land,\nIn one day he gathered in more money Than the parson in a month of Sundays. And thus with feigned flattery, his japes Made people and the parson his apes.\nBut to tell true from first to last,\nHe was in church a noble ecclesiast.\nHe read a lesson well or a story,\nBut best of all he sang an Offertory.\nFor well he knew, when that song was sung, He must preach and well tune his tongue To win silver, as he well knew how; Therefore he sang more sweetly and loud.\nNow I have told you in a brief clause, The array, condition, number and the cause Whereby assembled was this company,\nIn Southwark at that noble hostelry\nCalled The Tabard, fast by The Bell.\nBut now the time has come for me to tell How we behaved on that same night,\nAt that hostelry where we did alight;\nAnd after will I tell, at every stage,\nAll the remainder of our pilgrimage.\nBut first I pray you of your courtesy,\nNot to consider me unmannerly\nIf I speak plainly in this matter,\nIn telling you their words hereafter, Though I speak their words literally;\nFor this you know as well as me,\nWhoso tells the tale of another man\nMust repeat as closely as he canEvery word, if it be in his power,\nHowever coarse or broad his dower\nOf words, or else his tale will be untrue,\nOr feign things, inventing words anew.\nHe may spare none, though it were his brother, Must say the one word if he says the other. Christ himself spoke plain in Holy Writ,\nAnd you well know no coarseness is in it.\nAs Plato says, to any who can read,\nThe words must be cousin to the deed.\nAlso I beg you, if you will, forgive me\nIf I have not placed folk in due degree\nHere in this tale, as they indeed should stand;\nI lack the wit, you may well understand.\nOur HOST made great cheer for everyone, And down to supper set us all anon.\nHe served us with victuals of the best:\nStrong was the wine, we drank with zest.\nA handsome man our Host was withal,\nAnd fit to be a marshal in a hall.\nA large man he was with striking eyes;\nNo fairer burgess was there in Cheapside. Bold in his speech, and wise, and well taught, And of honest manhood he lacked naught. Add that he was a truly merry man;\nAnd after supper jokingly began\nTo speak of entertainment and other things, After we had paid our reckonings,\nSaying to us: ‘Now lordings, truly\nTo me you are right welcome, heartily!\nFor by my troth and telling you no lie,\nI have not seen this year such folk go by\nAs gathered together in this tavern now.\nAnd I would entertain, if I knew how,\nYet there is an entertainment, in my thoughts, To amuse you and it will cost you naught.\nYou go to Canterbury – God you speed!May the blissful martyr bless you indeed! – And well I know, as you go on your way You intend to chatter and make hay.\nFor truly, comfort and delight is none\nIn riding on the way dumb as a stone.\nAnd therefore I offer you some sport,\nAs I first said, to give you some comfort. And if you agree as one and consent\nEach of you to accept my judgement,\nAnd to work it as I to you will say, Tomorrow when you ride on your way, Now, by my father’s soul, he being dead,\nIf you lack merriment, be it on my head! Hold up your hands, without longer speech.’\nOur decision was not long to seek:\nWe thought it not worth serious debating, And gave him leave, without deliberating,\nAnd bade him give his orders as he wished, ‘Lordings,’ quoth he, ‘now listen to the rest – But hear me out, I pray, without disdain – Here is the point, to tell you short and plain: That each of you, to speed you on your way, On the journey there, shall tell two tales,\nTill Canterbury, I mean it so,\nAnd on the homeward way another two,\nOf adventures that did once befall.\nAnd which of you that bears them best of all – That is to say, who tells in this case\nTales the most serious that most solace –\nShall have a supper and we pay the cost,\nHere in this place, sitting by this post,\nWhen that we come again from Canterbury. And to make you all the more merry,\nI will myself gladly with you ride,\nAll at my own cost, and be your guide.\nAnd whoever my judgement does gainsay Shall pay all that we spend by the way.And if you will agree it shall be so, Tell me now, without more ado,\nAnd I will get me ready for the dawn.’\nThe thing was agreed, and our oath sworn With right good heart, and we begged also That he accordingly would do so,\nAnd that he act then as our governor,\nAnd of our tales be judge and recorder, And fix the supper at a certain price, And we would be ruled by his device, In high and low, and thus by one assent We all agreed to his true judgement. And the wine was brought, thereupon We drank, and to rest went everyone, Without our any longer tarrying.\nNext morning, when the day began to spring, Up rose our Host and roused us like the cock, And gathered us together in a flock;\nAnd forth we rode, at barely walking-pace\nTo Saint Thomas, and his watering place. And there our Host held the reins still, And said: ‘Lordings, hearken if you will! You know what you agreed, as I record. If even-song and morning-song accord, Let us see who shall tell the first tale.\nAs ever I hope to drink wine and ale,\nWhoever is a rebel to my judgement\nShall pay for all that on the way is spent.\nNow draw a straw before our journeying;\nAnd he that has the shortest shall begin.\n‘Sir Knight,’ quoth he, ‘my master and my lord, Now make the draw for that is our accord. Come near,’ quoth he, ‘my lady Prioress,\nAnd you, Sir Cleric, hide your bashfulness, No pondering now – a hand from everyone!’\nAt once by each the draw was begun; And to tell you how it was, as I relate,Whether by happenstance or chance or fate, The truth is this: the lot fell to the Knight, Which filled us all with joy and delight.\nAnd tell his tale he must, in due season, According to our pact and our decision,\nAs you have heard – what needs more ado? And when this good man saw that it was so, As he was wise and given to obedience\nAnd keeping promises with free assent,\nHe said: ‘Since I shall begin the game,\nWhy, welcome is the outcome, in God’s name! Now let us ride, and hark at what I say.’\nAnd with that word we rode forth on our way, And he began, all merry and full of cheer\nHis tale anon, and spoke as you may hear.",
